Freedom to create knowledge
Mariluce Moura -- Editor @-@ in @-@ chief
Even before making any comments on the cover feature of this Pesquisa FAPESP issue , I would like to recommend that you read the beautiful " back @-@ and @-@ forth " interview with physicist Moysés Nussenzveig , conducted by our science editor , Ricardo Zorzetto ( page 10 ) .
I insist upon this word , less for the extraordinary attractiveness of optical phenomena such as rainbows and aureoles , objects of this scientist 's investigation , which , however , he does not discuss at length in this interview , and more for the fight that he has undertaken throughout his life to make room for the free production and the creative and intelligent transmission of knowledge in Brazil , in particular in the field of physics .
Moreover , this is what appears on the scene when he tells us about the newest area of knowledge dissemination that he is involved in , namely , the republishing and sale at newsstands of the science kits that were a countrywide success back in the 1970s .
Or when he recalls all the domestic and international efforts in which he took part to protect scientists threatened by the furor of the Brazilian dictatorship ( 1964 @-@ 1985 ) .
Incidentally , professor Nussenzveig gave us two documents from his personal archives concerning the persecution of two scientists for us to photograph and print in this issue ( page 15 ) .
Finally , it is to the notion of a network , of the necessary cooperation among many people to create knowledge , that he alludes to when he covers his recollections of practically all the important names in twentieth century physics .
I will take advantage of the end of this paragraph and the affinity between the fields to recommend you also read the article by our scientific and technological policy editor , Fabricio Marques , on the outstanding efforts that are under way to incorporate the progress of mathematics over the last 100 years into the teaching of this subject in Brazil ( page 28 ) .
Now , let us move on to the cover feature .
I think it would be hard to imagine that the proliferation of veins and arteries could be bad .
The mental image one has of them , even as I write these words , is loaded with the suggestion of a good organic process , full of vitality .
Perhaps because blood vessels branching out , growing , dividing , spreading -- as described in the article 's opening lines by our assistant science editor , Maria Guimarães -- are nothing more than normal and highly desirable when human ( and other ) embryos are developing .
In adulthood , however , nothing good comes from this process , which is connected to serious diseases such as cancer , or hardships such as blindness .
In the midst of the growing knowledge about this pathological process , a good piece of new has arisen , which has led to the well @-@ written text that won the journal 's cover : a peptide or protein fragment assembled by the biochemist Ricardo Giordano , from the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , can find and destroy these undesirable blood vessels , beating the body 's defense system , thanks to what has proven to be just about a veritable set of mirrors .
All the details of this original biochemical construction , which may lead to a pharmaceutical drug to fight such adverse angiogenesis in the future , are described starting on page 18 .
I will continue to focus briefly on the science section , to recommend an article that provides yet one more part of the puzzle for us to piece together the history of Gondwana , the supercontinent in the remote past that encompassed most of the lands now found in the southern hemisphere .
Starting on page 56 , our special editor , Marcos Pivetta , reports on how Brazilian and American researchers , by resorting to new dating of rocks and analyses of the magnetic field in sections of a mountain range in Central Brazil , concluded that the final event that formed Gondwana did not occur 620 million years ago , but 520 million years ago .
This means , among other things , that the Amazon Region spent much more time apart from the supercontinent than we had believed up to now .
To close , I cannot fail to highlight the technology section 's opening article on a new type of battery built in Brazil for electric cars , written by the technology editor , Marcos de Oliveira ( page 67 ) , and the article that opens the humanities section , on a provocative research study that dislocates anthropologists from the old position of translators and recasts them as inventors , written by our humanities editor , Carlos Haag , and by myself .
Enjoy your reading !

The early days of steel @-@ mills
Poor technical know @-@ how made it difficult to set up a new industry in Brazil 200 years ago
Neldson Marcolin
Brazil 's first major investment in steel milling started with a fiasco that went on for four years in the early nineteenth century .
Despite the Portuguese government 's efforts to plan and support metallurgical enterprises , it took this industry a long time to firmly establish itself in Brazil .
That there was iron ore in the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo had been an established fact for quite a while .
Therefore , in the late eighteenth century , the Portuguese sponsored the training of Portuguese and Brazilians at the best European metallurgical centers .
However , it was only when the Portuguese Court moved to Brazil that the superintendent Manoel Ferreira da Câmara Bittencourt was allowed , in 1809 , to establish the basis of the Patriotica plant in Gaspar Soares , now Morro do Pilar , Minas Gerais state .
Almost at the same time , the Portuguese administration ordered the construction of the São João de Ipanema Royal Iron Mill ( Real Fábrica de Ferro ) in Iperó , São Paulo state , opened in 1810 .
The two concerns took years to produce any metal whatsoever .
" The lack of suitable know @-@ how and of specialized labor was only partially overcome in Brazil during the second half of the 1810s , says Fernando Landgraf , the Innovation director of IPT ( the Technological Research Institute ) and a researcher at the Polytechnic School at the University of São Paulo .
Portugal had always been aware of the importance of controlling the entire iron ore export cycle and of the transformation of ore into the three families of products known in the early nineteenth century : pig iron ( iron with carbon content of about 4 % ) , wrought iron ( carbon content below 0.1 % ) and steel ( carbon content around 1 % ) .
In Europe , the English , Swedes and Germans from Saxony and Hesse had the tradition of steel mills with hundreds of blast furnaces in these regions .
That was where , in the first decade of 1800 , the Portuguese hired Frederico Luiz Guilherme Varnhagen and Guilherme Eschwege , Germans who advised José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in the Figueiró dos Vinhos Iron Plant in Portugal .
Furthermore , it was in Sweden that the administration of the Empire hired a technical team headed by an experienced man , Carl Gustav Hedberg , to start producing the metal in Brazil .
It was crucial to be familiar with blast furnace construction techniques in order to make iron successfully .
" Blast furnaces run on an ongoing basis ; they never stop , which makes all the difference when it comes to producing the metal , " says Landgraf , the author of a newly published article in Metalurgia e Metais , written jointly by Paulo Eduardo Martins Araújo and Sven @-@ Gunnar Sporback , a Swede , who investigated that period .
Hedberg was chosen for his experience with blast furnaces and he brought to Iperó other technicians and machines purchased abroad .
The outcome , however , was disappointing .
From 1811 to 1814 , he built four small melting furnaces , a foundry , refining forges , canals , a waterwheel and a reservoir but he abandoned the established notion of a blast furnace , producing only three tons of very poor quality iron over four years .
There was also another problem : ignorance of how to deal with the type of iron ore from that area .
At the other foundry ( Morro do Pilar , in Minas Gerais state ) , the blast furnace built yielded even less .
" Without the right technique , superintendent Câmara only managed to smelt iron for three days . "
Interview >
A student of the phenomena of light , the physicist presents his project of re @-@ launching scientific kits for children and adolescents .
Ricardo Zorzetto
Among researchers , Herch Moysés Nussenzveig may be better known for his work in optics .
Since the 1960s , this native of São Paulo state who graduated in physics from the University of São Paulo ( USP ) and who has lived for almost 50 years in Rio de Janeiro , where he currently teaches at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) , researches two of the most beautiful phenomena in existence : rainbows and aureoles .
The first , whose colors appear in the order we all know , arises in the sky when sunrays are deflected from their path and spread through droplets of water into the atmosphere .
However , learning about this 77 @-@ year old physicist just through his optics work is not enough .
From the very start of his career , Moysés , as his friends call him , always worked hard at teaching physics : he organized courses , wrote a collection of books that are still used in universities , created physics departments and helped to organize the structure that finances Brazilian research .
During the military regime , while living in the United States , he did what he could to help researchers that were the victims of political persecution .
He welcomed those who had to leave the country , denounced to the international scientific community what was going on here and organized protests that reached president Arthur da Costa e Silva ( see documents on page 15 ) .
Within his family , he is surrounded by science .
One of them , Victor , is an internationally renowned immunologist , known for his studies on malaria ; his wife , Micheline , is a chemist ; and his three children are also researchers : Helena is a mathematician , Paulo is a physicist and Roberto is a biochemist .
About three years ago , Nussenzveig set himself a new challenge : to reissue the science kits of the 1970s that encouraged children and adolescents to become researchers .
Despite the difficulties encountered , he has not considered quitting .
" It 's the best thing we could do for education over the next few years , to establish a sound basis for the country 's development , " he states .
Read below the main segments of the interview Nussenzveig granted Pesquisa FAPESP on May 28 , in his apartment , in the Copacabana district of the city of Rio de Janeiro .
You are a member of the group that is working toward re @-@ launching the science kit sold in newsstands in the 1970s .
How is this project doing ?
Were you familiar with the kits ?
I have never seen one .
I only know that they used to be made by the Editora Abril publishing house .
At the time , Isaias Raw had done some wonderful work at Funbec [ the Brazilian Foundation for the Teaching of Science ] and had prepared the kits , but with local distribution , on a modest scale .
He contacted Roberto Civita [ the Editora Abril publisher ] , who decided to create a project , Os Cientistas [ The Scientists ] .
The kits were very well made ; they came in little Styrofoam boxes and each issue was dedicated to one of history 's great scientists .
The most important part was made out of simple material , but it had to work well to enable the purchasers of the kit to replicate crucial experiments of the scientist that had led to the fundamental laws in some scientific area .
For instance , there was a kit about [ the English physicist and chemist , Michael ] Faraday .
To test the law of induction , the kit included a magnet , a wire , a bobbin and batteries .
Everything had to be assembled by the child who had bought it .
The issues came out every fortnight and included a leaflet with the scientist 's biography and the history of the discovery .
It also came with instructions on how to assemble the device and what should be measured , besides questions about the results .
Was this successful ?
It was fantastically successful .
At the time , my children were in Brazil and they loved these kits , which had been designed for middle school students .
When I thought about recreating the project , three years ago , I was part of DNA Brasil [ an institute established by the Ralston Semler Foundation to discuss development strategies for Brazil ] , along with many renowned scientists .
I found that several of them had turned to science thanks to the kits , including [ Carlos Henrique de ] Brito Cruz , FAPESP 's scientific director , and Jerson Lima and Silva , FAPERJ 's scientific director .
I presented the proposal to the group and it was approved .
We contacted Sergio Rezende , the minister of Science and Technology , who liked the idea , and Isaias Raw , who agreed with the re @-@ launch .
We planned an initial meeting , including Civita and Isaias .
My idea was to establish a coordinating board comprising scientists willing to fully support the project .
This is not easy .
We have been meeting since 2008 .
The idea is to get this into newsstands , and Abril can provide nationwide distribution .
This would ensure the kits getting to a village in the Amazon Region , just as they would get to São Paulo .
The fundamental point is that children find out about the kit so that it arouses among them the enthusiasm for doing something with real objects .
These experiments , as occasionally happens in laboratories , don 't always work out .
One must discover why they didn 't work and fix them .
This is what is lacking in science instruction in Brazil .
Who is involved in the project ?
We have formed a kind of scientific board .
Besides Isaias , there was Myriam Krasilchik , from USP 's School of Education .
In biology , Mayana Zatz and Eliana Dessen .
In physics , besides myself , there is Vanderlei Bagnato , from USP in São Carlos .
In astronomy we have Beatriz Barbuy and , in chemistry , Henrique Toma .
We communicate with Brito Cruz , who doesn 't have the time to attend the meetings very often .
We have already held quite a few meetings and prepared a list of the kits and what they should contain .
Right from the first meetings I felt that to render the project financially viable , we would have to get MEC , the Ministry of Education , to participate .
MEC has made the publication of the journal Ciência Hoje [ published by SBPC , the Brazilian Society for Scientific Progress ] feasible , by buying Ciência Hoje das Crianças [ the children 's issue of the journal ] to distribute in schools .
The idea is that MEC would do something similar with the kits .
There is a large number of government schools and this might make it cheaper to sell the kits in newsstands .
Isaias and Civita agree with me that it would be useless to only have the kits in the schools , because they would probably end up collecting dust in a drawer .
It 's entirely different to have something that the child is obliged to do from something the child plays with , discovering things along the way .
Something the child does with pleasure .
That is what is missing .
Motivation .
This will influence instruction because the child does what it says , then has a doubt and takes it to school .
This child will provoke the teacher , who will have to learn in order to respond .
What is being done , which is to retrain teachers and train new ones , is important .
However , it 's a decade @-@ long project .
Meanwhile , one wastes children 's huge potential , as they could be motivated .
When Brazil manages to make industry understand that the development of cutting @-@ edge technology is fundamental in order to compete in the current world , there won 't be enough manpower .
It 's a problem that starts way back , in elementary school .
Our manpower is so poorly educated that it won 't know how to perform simple tasks , because in some types of service everything is computerized .
That is why we believe this project is crucial .
Civita was so enthusiastic about it that at first he said he 'd finance it without MEC .
At the end of last year , however , he said that he would need MEC support and , to this end , he proposed a project for the classroom , rather than for sale in newsstands , which rather changes the project 's essence .
It was a severe blow , but we decided to present it to BNDES [ the National Economic and Social Development Bank ] , which , through the Funtec Technological Fund provides non @-@ refundable grants .
At least for the first few years , the project will have to be government @-@ funded this way and with the support of MEC , which would acquire the issues unsold in the newsstands and send them to the schools .
Even if the project were only implemented in the Southeast states , it would still require a R $ 10 million investment , at least .
In newsstands , it is expected to retail for R $ 15 to R $ 20 , the price of a magazine .
How many kits will be in this collection ?
From 15 to 20 , encompassing all the areas .
An integral part of it is a telescope called the Galileuscope .
I bought one for US $ 15 in the United States .
The company would make it for less in Brazil , making it feasible to put it into the kits .
In São Carlos , Bagnato has been trying to get a microscope manufactured at an affordable price .
You haven 't given up .
The prototype of the first kit , made by Bagnato , is on my desk .
There is nothing in the world to compare to this project .
In the medium @-@ term , this could give rise to a for @-@ profit company to distribute it even in other countries .
There is a worldwide shortage of something like this .
The problem is that in Brazil our situation is worse than the average in developed countries .
If BNDES buys the idea , this is the best thing we could do for education in the next few years , to establish a sound basis for development in the country .
Changing subjects , I 'd like to learn about your path in physics , which , actually , didn 't start in physics .
I almost started in movies .
I was one of the organizers of what could have been Brazil 's first movie festival , at the São Paulo Art Museum , in 1950 .
Why did you choose mathematics ?
At the Aliança Francesa school of French , I took a two to three year literature course .
In the last year , the school got a scholarship from the French government , to be awarded by means of a competition .
This consisted of writing an essay on , if I remember correctly , the cultural legacy of France .
I won the award , a trip and a one @-@ year scholarship to study anywhere in France .
I had my doubts between attending the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques , in Paris , or doing mathematics .
I chose mathematics and took a one @-@ year course called Mathématiques Générales , at the Sorbonne .
Because of a colleague , Ernest Hamburger , who was working with Oscar Sala to set up a Van de Graff accelerator at USP , I switched to physics .
I spent part of my undergraduate years as an experimental physics trainee .
After the third or fourth year of physics , I became interested in theoretical physics .
I was lucky because a foreign visiting professor appeared at that time , an important American physicist , David Bohm .
He had worked with J. Robert Oppenheimer , the coordinator of the American atom bomb project , hadn 't he ?
He had worked with Oppenheimer and was one of the pivots of the interrogation in which Oppenheimer was questioned about security .
Bohm had reputedly been a communist .
They often questioned Oppenheimer about David Bohm ; I have the transcript of these interrogations .
Bohm moved from California to Princeton and was requested to make a statement to the Anti @-@ American Activities Committee of [ senator Joseph ] McCarthy .
On Einstein 's advice , Bohm refused and the university fired him .
It was a disgrace for Princeton to have done that .
I taught at the University of Rochester for 10 years , where a similar case occurred .
Bohm came to USP with letters of recommendation from Einstein and from Oppenheimer .
The department head was Mario Schönberg .
Every now and again Oppenheimer was questioned about having given a recommendation for a communist , Bohm , to work with another known communist , Schönberg .
However , it was lucky for me .
How did you meet him ?
Bohm taught an excellent theoretical physics course as well as my first quantum mechanics course .
He continued to suffer political persecution here , however .
When he arrived in Brazil , he went to the American Embassy in Rio de Janeiro , where they asked for his passport and said they wouldn 't return it until he went back to the United States .
He became a naturalized Brazilian and when he travelled to Israel , at the invitation of Technion [ the Technical Institute of Israel ] , it was with a Brazilian passport .
Then he went to London , where he married an Englishwoman .
Many years later , his mother was seriously ill and he wanted to visit her in the United States , now holding British nationality , but the visa was denied .
At the time , the number of important physicists was no greater than a few dozen and he had been through all the major institutes and laboratories .
He knew those who had established quantum mechanics .
In the 1940s , when France was under [ German ] occupation , Beck was interned in a camp for foreigners .
There 's a letter from Max Born to Einstein , asking for financial help for Beck , who had managed to escape to Portugal ; from there , thanks to an invitation from Argentina , he went to the Córdoba observatory .
He spent several years in Argentina and was one of the founders of the Argentine Association of Physics .
What happened next ?
Beck came to Brazil and joined CBPF [ the Brazilian Physics Research Center , in Rio de Janeiro ] , at the time a privately owned institution .
When Bohm left , Beck was invited by Schönberg to replace him and spent two years in São Paulo .
Beck sent the thesis to Max Born , who was in Scotland , and then an odd thing happened .
Emil Wolf , one of the great names in optics , was working with Born and was invited to go to the University of Rochester , in New York state .
When he was about to board , Born said to him : " I just got this thesis ; as you 're going by ship , read it during your trip . "
Later , it was Wolf who invited me to Rochester , when I was at Princeton .
Prior to that , you spent some time in several European institutes .
I spent one year in the Netherlands , mainly in Utrecht , a leading institute .
I also spent some time in Birmingham , which had Europe 's most famous physics department , with the great physicist Rudolf Peierls , plus some time in Zurich , with another famous physicist , Res Jost .
Every year the Federal Congress would vote on CBPF 's budget .
When inflation got out of hand , the CBPF budget collapsed .
In 1963 , a senior professor was earning US $ 60 a month , equal perhaps to about US $ 300 today , so Beck recommended that I leave the country .
So this was the start of your work in the United States .
I got an invitation from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and , in September 1963 , I moved there with Micheline and our daughter , Helena , who was four months old at the time .
At the embassy 's recommendation , we got permanent visas , but our intention was to stay there for a year or two and then come back .
Soon thereafter Darcy Ribeiro organized the University of Brasilia [ UnB ] and invited Roberto Salmeron to organize the UnB institutes .
While passing through the United States in February or March of 1964 , Salmeron invited me to become a professor in Brasilia .
In principle , I accepted .
That was when I thought : " If I 'm going to stay in the States for only a short while , I 'm going to try somewhere else before I go back . "
I wrote to Oppenheimer and he said I could spend a year at Princeton .
Meanwhile , things were getting more complicated in Brazil .
When the University of Brasilia was invaded and all the professors fired , Micheline and I thought : " We can 't go back now . "
That was when Emil Wolf , who had read my thesis on board the ship , invited me to be a visiting professor at Rochester .
In 1965 , we moved there and in 1968 , I came to Brazil to teach some courses on quantum optics at PUC in Rio de Janeiro .
Sergio Rezende himself [ the current minister of Science and Technology ] said that he started to work on a related subject thanks to this course .
Meanwhile , we kept postponing our return to Brazil and , at Rochester , the New York state government created a position called the Albert Einstein Professor , to attract people of a very high grade to teach in New York .
Elliott Montroll , a great physicist , accepted the position , created the Institute of Fundamental Studies and invited me to join it .
This was in 1968 .
That very same year , I got a letter from a PUC colleague saying that the best physics student had been expelled because of decree 477 , which required that students considered subversive be expelled .
This student was Luiz Davidovich .
In the letter , my friend asked whether I could receive Davidovich at Rochester .
It was not the admission period , but I talked to some colleagues and they accepted .
Did you get other invitations ?
In 1969 , I got another invitation to return to Brazil to be the A in Impa [ the Pure and Applied Mathematics Institute ] , which had no applied mathematics area .
Again , I accepted .
In April 1969 , when Maurício Peixoto got to Rochester to discuss my return , I got a telegram from Ernest Hamburger , who was the chair of the Brazilian Society of Physics , saying that [ Jayme ] Tiomno and José Leite Lopes had been made to retire .
I went to the airport to talk to Peixoto , showed him the telegram and said : " Under these circumstances , I cannot accept the invitation . "
The situation was dramatic and I tried to do something to help the persecuted scientists .
They were the first generation of physicists that had trained in Brazil .
Tiomno , Leite Lopes and Schönberg , all of them had to retire .
The telegram I got was dated April 27 and on the following day I wrote to Robert Marshak , a professor at Rochester and a member of the United States Academy of Sciences , talking about the political persecution of Brazilian scientists and saying that 69 professors had been fired from universities .
Was this sort of action common among Brazilian researchers abroad ?
To the best of my knowledge , I did this in the United States , and Salmeron did it in Paris .
I contacted the scientists I knew , informing them of what was going on in Brazil .
Soon thereafter , the board of the American Society of Physics sent a letter to the Brazilian ambassador , Mário Gibson Barbosa , commenting that Leite Lopes and Tiomno had been persecuted and asking that they do whatever they could to defend them .
I have a huge file that I hesitated to bring back to Brazil , because when I returned , in 1975 , it was still unsafe to have these documents here .
Based on the contacts I had made , a lot of protest telegrams had been sent .
One of them went straight to Costa e Silva [ Arthur da Costa e Silva , then the President of the Republic ] , signed by virtually all the professors from the Rochester physics department .
I also wrote an article for Science about the " Migration of Latin American scientists , " because these persecutions were also occurring in Argentina .
A few years later , the New York governor , Nelson Rockefeller , visited Brazil and [ Chen Ning ] Yang , whom I had met at Princeton and who was a Nobel Prize laureate , asked me what he and Rockefeller could do about this .
At Yang 's request , Rockefeller talked to Costa e Silva .
How did you manage to return to the country ?
In 1975 , [ José ] Goldemberg , who headed the Physics Institute , invited me to return to USP .
I sat an exam for senior professorship and imposed one condition : to create a theoretical physics department , which ended up being called mathematical physics .
I started teaching graduate courses , but I soon realized that the most important course was actually the undergraduate one , in particular basic physics .
As I lacked a text that I felt was suitable , I decided to write my own .
So is that how the Curso de Física Básica [ Basic Physics Course ] series came into being ?
As I taught the course , I would write notes on the different themes .
Enio Candotti , who taught at UFRJ , heard about this and kept asking me for copies to use in his lectures .
Partly at his insistence , I wrote the entire course .
While you were at USP , you headed the Physics Institute , didn 't you ?
At that time , Goldemberg had stepped down from the position of director of the institute and , according to its internal rules , the senior professors were automatically candidates for the position of director .
I had created the Mathematical Physics Department and wanted to consolidate it .
One day , I get to the institute and they tell me that the Diário Oficial [ Government Gazette ] had published my appointment as director , without my having been consulted .
I sent a letter to the mathematician Valdir Oliva , who was the university 's president at the time , saying that I didn ´ t accept it .
He told the institute that if I didn 't accept , he 'd appoint a sort of intervenor .
My colleagues put me against the wall and I was obliged to accept .
It was during this time that I started sitting on the advisory committee for physics of CNPq [ the National Scientific and Technological Development Council ] .
At that time , people were beginning to talk about amnesty and I , at the request of SBPC , was on the commission that delivered the amnesty project concerning professors retired through the AI @-@ 5 Institutional Act , those 69 people , to the minister of Justice , Petrônio Portela .
As head of the institute , I was able to invite Schönberg to return to USP .
During my term , around 1980 , the São Paulo state governor , Paulo Maluf , pulled a fast one on FAPESP by coming up with a different interpretation of the law that established the Foundation 's funding .
I launched a campaign from the institute to the University Board of Governors to protest against the government .
Knowing USP and its Board of Governors , this was not a trivial matter .
Eventually , the government backed off .
In 1981 , I was still at USP when I was elected chairman of the Brazilian Society of Physics .
Argentina was in the process of getting rid of its military dictatorship and the Argentine Association of Physics invited me to a meeting , the first one held under a democratic regime .
On this occasion , the atomic project of the Argentine military for building a bomb was discussed .
I returned from the meeting with the chairman of the Argentine Association and we came up with the idea of making a joint statement by the two societies recommending that the physicists of both countries not take part in projects with a military purpose .
Here , I established the Monitoring Commission on Nuclear Issues , comprised of Luiz Pinguelli Rosa , Fernando de Souza Barros and Sergio Rezende , to look into the existence of a military project in Brazil .
Pinguelli and Barros discovered , during the Collor administration , the well in the Serra do Cachimbo and got Collor to admit that there had been a project .
Everything was blocked .
The Brazilian Society of Physics and the Argentine Society of Physics played an important role in this story .
A mutual inspection project between the two countries was created .
Why did you leave USP ?
I was in the limelight there because of this statement from the University Board and I was shocked when I found out about the USP " maharajas , " which led to my leaving it .
Was that when you joined PUC in Rio de Janeiro ?
I joined PUC as a visiting professor and later I became a senior professor .
During this time , I was appointed by the Academy of Sciences to sit on a joint commission with SBPC that aimed at advocating research and the financing of projects .
During the dictatorship , the people in charge of the Science and Technology budget were from Seplan , the Planning Bureau , under minister Delfim Netto .
Seplan , with the participation of an economist , Luiz Paulo Rosenberg , and Claudio de Moura Castro , did a project to reformulate research financing in order to make changes in Finep , CNPq and Capes .
It would have been a disaster .
The situation was already bad , because the scientific community didn ´ t take part in the approval of the budgets .
A commission that brought together SBPC , ABC and , at first , Seplan , started to show what it wanted to do .
We managed to mobilize the scientific community and to present another proposal , reformulating the statutes of CNPq and of Finep , and creating a deliberative board for each , with the participation of the scientific community .
You were trying to bring the researchers into CNPq to help decide how to invest the money .
Exactly .
Our project led not only to the establishment of the CNPq deliberative board but also influenced the creation of the Ministry of Science and Technology .
Almost as a form of punishment , they elected me the scientific community 's representative on the first board .
I also helped to write the CNPq 's internal rules .
What role did you play in the creation of Pronex , the finance program for centers of excellence ?
When I joined the CNPq deliberative board , I decided to present this idea , which was the result of one of the last things I had done in Brazil in 1963 , before moving to the United States .
José Pelúcio Ferreira had created Funtec , Finep 's predecessor , having been inspired , partly , by the articles that Leite Lopes was writing on the importance of financing science for economic development .
The first project for Funtec support of graduate work was written by Leite Lopes and me .
All graduate studies in Brazil are the offspring of Funtec and Finep .
The idea was to create a form of support for such an institute .
Pelúcio said : " Why don 't you take a look at the French system of associated laboratories ? "
In France , I talked to Pierre Jacquinot , who had founded the laboratories that were associated with CNRS .
That was when I presented the idea of Associated Research Entities to the deliberative board ; it was approved around 1985 .
So although they 're private , the institutes could get federal financing , right ?
The idea was that this should involve long @-@ term projects of at least four years , and that they should be renewable .
The story of how this project led to Pronex is published in an interview of mine with Ciência Hoje .
After the ministry had been created , with the election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso , this turned into a demand by the scientific community .
Fernando Henrique was sensitive to this and created the program , maintaining the essential points .
The program was called Pronex , a name I disliked .
Why ?
One of the reasons is that it conveys the idea that it would have to be of an extremely high level to join this group .
And that wasn 't what it was all about .
And neither is it in France .
The idea was that the good institutes get stable financing .
This wasn 't meant to select two or three .
Fernando Henrique hoped for no more than some 20 or 30 centers in the country .
However , in the first project there were 77 and in the second , 84 .
Pronex was the source of the National Institutes of Science and Technology .
One of the core ideas was to conduct a national evaluation of research .
The projects are presented throughout the country and only the best ones are chosen , with evaluation at an international level .
I was on the coordinating commission of the first Pronex and we sent many projects abroad for assessment , asking that the strictness of the evaluation be akin to that applied to a National Science Foundation project .
What type of institute did you evaluate ?
All the institutes , such as Impa , CBPF and Inpa in the Amazon Region .
We evaluated institutes all over the country and made recommendations .
One of them is that they should be run similarly to the current Inpa , based on management contracts and greater autonomy .
At the National Conference of Science , Technology and Innovation , held in Brasilia in May , the scientists ' chief request was to reduce the red tape surrounding the importation of scientific material .
And why did you move to UFRJ ?
My last change of institution took place some 15 years ago , when the FNDCT [ National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development ] support for PUC 's Technical and Scientific Center in Rio de Janeiro came to an end .
As a result , the senior physics professors at PUC moved to UFRJ .
Before joining URFJ , its president at that time , Nelson Maculan , had invited me and Jacob Palis to take part in an advanced studies institute .
I have never wanted to be in such an institute because in general there is little interaction with the university and the students .
Instead , we created Copea , the Coordinating Office for Advanced Studies Program .
Its role is to promote interdisciplinary research in cutting @-@ edge subjects that would not be addressed by the university otherwise .
This is a worldwide trend .
We also felt it was important to hold conferences open to the public and to have one 's own research group .
And as this had to focus on a cutting @-@ edge area that did not exist previously at UFRJ , I decided to set quantum optics aside and created the Optical Tweezers Laboratory .
I 'm curious to hear about the rainbow and the aureole theory , which you started working on in the 1960s .
There is far more recent work .
An article on the aureole theory is about to be published in Scientific American .
The rainbow and the aureole are two of the prettiest phenomena in nature .
What is an aureole ?
The best way of describing this is to show it .
You can observe it from airplanes .
You have to know the Sun 's position and be able to locate the plane 's shadow on the clouds .
With luck , you will see the plane 's shadow and , around it , what looks like a circular rainbow .
It isn 't .
It 's an aureole , which is different .
You can see several concentric rings .
The order of the colors is different .
One of the great names in optics , Joseph von Fraunhofer , proposed that this might be a sort of reflection on the cloud .
He was wrong .
The explanation results from tunneling , an intriguing phenomenon .
Light can behave as wave or as a particle .
As a particle , in would be unable to penetrate the droplets of water .
As a wave , it goes through the surface by tunneling .
Within the drop , it reverberates before emerging by tunneling and producing the aureole .
Was this the work that won an award ?
I won the Max Born award in 1986 for the rainbow and aureole theory .
However , at the time , a substantial part of the explanation of the aureole was still missing , and it accumulated over the years .
The final demonstration that it is a tunneling phenomenon is one of my latest works .

Attacking undesirable veins and arteries could fight cancer and blindness
Maria Guimarães
Imagine veins and arteries that branch out , grow , split and spread .
Normal during embryo development , in adulthood this formation and proliferation of blood vessels might be at the source of serious problems , such as blindness and cancer .
The biochemist Ricardo Giordano , from the Chemistry Institute at the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , has been finding ways of localizing and exterminating these blood vessels that sprout out of place and in an untimely fashion .
He has developed a peptide ( protein fragment ) that brings together highly desirable qualities in a potential pharmaceutical substance to fight these problems : the molecule is able to find blood vessels that should be created -- and it does this circumventing the body 's defenses , which are unable to recognize the peptide as an intrusive substance to be fought .
The molecule , known as D ( DPR ) because it is made out of leucine , proline and arginine , was the result of the work of a couple of Brazilian researchers that jointly coordinate a laboratory at the M. D.
Anderson Cancer Institute in Texas , USA : the molecular biologist Renata Pasqualini and the oncologist physician and researcher Wadih Arap .
During the course of 10 years of post @-@ doctoral work in this lively environment full of equipment , minds and motivation to discover proteins that can have an impact on human diseases , Giordano used the CEP concept developed by Renata and Arap : each type of cell , in each of the body 's tissues , has a unique molecular signature that can be recognized by specific peptides , just like the number 05415 @-@ 012 designates a two @-@ block area in which postmen will find the offices of this journal .
And this worked , as shown in the article in the March issue of the journal PNAS .
To build trackers capable of overriding the radar of the immune system , Giordano used a conceptually simple trick based on the two categories of peptides , characterized for having certain chemical groups that go toward the right ( D ) or the left ( L ) .
" Nature chose to make proteins in the L form , " explains the biochemist .
It is as if the peptides that go around the blood and the cells were all left @-@ handed .
The enzymes in charge of destroying impurities , which are akin to left @-@ hand gloves , do not fit on right hands and therefore allow them to escape .
Thus , D ( LPR ) goes undetected , yet it does not fail to fulfill the role of its mirror twin , RPL .
The task , in this case , is to inhibit the production of the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , which is the substance mainly responsible for the proliferation of blood vessels .
" However , one can 't totally inhibit the activity of this growth factor : the VEGF 's basal function is important in order to maintain the blood vessels , " Giordano states .
He therefore looked for a right hand that might affect only the generation of new vessels , which was successfully achieved by D ( LPR ) on premature retinopathy , as the PNAS article shows ,
This is the cause of the musician Stevie Wonder 's visual handicap.Premature retinopathy mainly affects those babies that had to spend some time in an incubator when they were born .
As the oxygen pressure is very high ( about 70 % ) inside this type of equipment , when the child is taken into the natural atmosphere , with about 20 % of oxygen , the retina cells interpret this as a shortage of oxygen and produce more VEGF .
The outcome is a vascular web in the retina density so that it obstructs vision .
Giordano showed that the peptide D ( LPR ) can find such a formation of undesirable blood vessels , recognizing specific molecules in the membrane of the vascular cells .
" Because it 's small , the peptide is cheaper to produce and the likelihood of causing side @-@ effects is small , because the cell 's exterior is the most selective part ; therefore , the action is localized . "
When it fits into the cell 's surface , D ( LPR ) interferes with the VEGF activation chain , thus inhibiting exaggerated vascular proliferation .
In Giordano 's trials , the system worked on culture cells and on live mice .
Because it is small , stable and water @-@ soluble , the peptide developed by the biochemist has everything to be successful in the eyes of those who suffer from this type of eyesight problems , if it eventually does , indeed , result in a medical drug .
Besides retinopathy among premature babies , vascular proliferation in the retina also causes wet macular degeneration , the main cause of partial loss of vision connected with aging .
A D ( LPR ) drug might perhaps be applied in the form of eye drops , which would be a relief as compared to the current macular degeneration treatment , which consists of injections applied directly on the eye .
Wadih Arap has already had to have an eye injection due to a detached retina and has warned that it is awful .
Tracking a bomb - In the laboratory that he created last year upon returning from Texas and being hired by USP , Giordano is looking for new VEGF regions in mice that could function as therapeutic targets .
The benefits of this could extend way beyond eyesight illnesses .
Vascular proliferation or angiogenesis , stimulated by VEGG , is also what characterizes malignant tumors , which secrete angiogenesis factors to encourage the production of blood vessels that , in turn , feed the masses of cancerous cells .
" If we manage to fight this process , which normally doesn 't occur in adults , we will have yet one more weapon to fight cancer , " predicts the researcher .
Attacking VEGF is not a new idea .
There are some drugs against these factors , based on antibodies , that have been already approved and are in use , but , according to Giordano , they have proven to be less effective than scientists hoped and cause unpleasant side effects , a problem that he hopes to avoid with the targeted peptide that he has developed .
" There are hundreds of labs worldwide trying to develop this type of medication ; it 's a race . "
For him , more important than getting there first is to develop a pharmaceutical product in Brazil .
Not only to have more accessible drugs , but also to own the intellectual property for them , as this might aid further research .
One of Renata 's and Arap 's priorities now is to continue the tests to develop a drug based on the peptide developed by the collaborator from USP .
" We want to establish in São Paulo a branch of the company to which the M.D.
Anderson intellectual property is being licensed , in order to get partnerships and investment to develop drugs , " the researcher tells us .
One advantage of conducting the clinical trials here is testing the drug 's effectiveness on the Brazilian population , a validation that is independent from the effects of the drug on a larger number of patients .
In the future , D ( LPR ) may also prove effective against tumor irrigating blood vessels , but the group has prioritized the study of eye diseases to avoid the huge competition around the war on cancer , whereas , in Renata 's words , " there 's a vacuum surrounding retina treatments . "
The two researchers are in the right place .
M. D.
Anderson is a huge research center and hospital that specializes in cancer .
Here , one of the world 's benchmark reference centers where cancer treatment is concerned , and therefore a place that gets the toughest cases , the researchers have access to a large number of patients and huge scientific challenges .
Besides doing research , Arap sees hospital patients .
In the Texan laboratory , the two scientists that graduated from USP have been using the CEP ideal to fight cancer and obesity .
They have developed a prostate cancer drug that is in the initial stage of clinical trials on humans .
" We have already treated six patients , " Renata told us .
This initial stage , with only a few patients , after the drug has been tested on other species -- generally mice , dogs or monkeys -- is mandatory in order to assess the treatment 's possible toxic effects .
By finding the drug in tumor biopsies , the study validates the notion of using CEPs against cancer and other diseases -- a method that appears to be effective against fat cells , according to an article published by the group in 2004 , in Nature Medicine .
The peptide finds the specific molecular signature of the tumor or the fat and carries along with it a bomb -- the klaklac molecule ( see Pesquisa FAPESP no . 115 ) .
" It 's a corkscrew @-@ shaped structure rich in negative charges , which attach to the membrane of mitochondria , " Giordano describes .
Upon destroying the mitochondria , the cells ' power plant , klaklak specifically eliminates the undesirable cells , such as the blood vessels that irrigate tumors .
In an earlier research stage , Marina Cardó @-@ Vila , a Catalan researcher , worked together with Giordano at the M. D.
Anderson center , using similar techniques on different molecules .
She showed , in an article also published in the March issue of PNAS , that an inverted peptide ( D shaped ) system , such as that produced by her colleague , effectively inhibits the growth of mammary tumors in female mice .
Breathing space -- Besides pharmaceutical potential , Giordano 's tracking peptide has also been shown to be an effective research tool .
In collaboration with Rubin Tuder , a Lithuanian pathologist who graduated from USP and now teaches at the University of Colorado , he showed , in 2008 , in the Journal of Biological Chemistry , that the technique allows one to find and destroy blood vessels that maintain the structure of the lungs ' alveoli and cause lesions similar to those found in the lungs of smokers with emphysema .
In this case , the peptides work as an anti @-@ drug .
The idea of this is to produce , in labs , mice with emphysema pulmonary characteristic , in order to study the disease in greater depth .
Today , in order to look inside blood vessels , one must insert a catheter through the groin .
The researcher 's plan is to bind gold particles , for instance , with tracking peptides .
Gold is recognized by CAT scanners , a far less invasive test than catheterization .
" I 'm trying to identify peptides that locate these lung lesions to aid diagnostic imaging , " explains the pathologist .
He has already found , in patients ' cell cultures , promising molecules for this role and in another two months , he hopes to have further details to relate .
" Cancer is a very difficult disease , " comments Renata .
" Steps taken are small , the benefits , incremental ; but if one doesn 't try , nothing will be achieved . "

Modern mathematics
Project to take 20th century mathematics research progress into the classroom
Fabrício Marques
An ambitious project , led by scientific societies connected with research and with mathematics instruction in Brazil , aims to create a new paradigm for teaching the subject .
The Klein Project in Portuguese is to mobilize the Brazilian mathematical community to prepare teaching material that incorporates the progress achieved in this subject over the last 100 years .
A series of workshops will debate cutting @-@ edge themes in basic areas , such as algebra , geometry and topology , as well as in other areas that have arisen recently , such as applications in the field of computing .
The first workshop was to be held in early July , in Belo Horizonte .
" These workshops will focus on specific themes , with a lot of objective discussion , leading to producing texts , products and innovative ideas , " says Marcelo Viana , a researcher from Impa , the National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics , who is the project 's coordinator .
The material discussed in these workshops will be subsequently submitted to pilots , with the help of high school teachers and mathematical education undergraduates , in order to test them in real classrooms .
Mathematicians from Portugal are also working on the project ; it is hoped that the project 's contribution will reach other Portuguese @-@ speaking countries .
The key objective is to make schoolteachers familiar with achievements in mathematical research , helping them to understand them and to establish connections with the traditional contents .
" We don 't want to re @-@ invent the instruction system , but to improve it , making it more interesting and effective , " states Viana .
The project organizers include representatives from SBM ( the Brazilian Mathematical Society ) , SBEM ( the Brazilian Mathematical Education Society ) , SBHMat ( the Brazilian Mathematics History Society ) and SBMAC ( the Brazilian Society of Applied and Computer Mathematics ) , as well as from OBMEP ( the Brazilian Mathematics Olympics of Public Schools ) .
According to them , strengthening the training of teachers is crucial in order to introduce into the classrooms the wide scope of basic mathematics , whose contents , to their minds , are being taught in a fragmented and mechanical fashion .
" In general , mathematics is taught mechanically , based on the introduction of abstract concepts but without a clear understanding and on the repetition of methods , without encouraging creativity and discovery .
This makes the instruction both inefficient and disliked by students , " says Yuriko Yamamoto Baldin , a professor at the Mathematics Department of the Federal University of São Carlos ( UFSCar ) and one of the project 's coordinators .
The absence of recent mathematical achievements in the school curriculum results in the defective education of students .
" The students , when they get to university , are faced with a way of working with mathematics with which they did not become familiar during school , " she states .
Poincaré 's Conjecture -- According to the professor , only rarely are mathematics teachers able to address research subjects in the classroom , as these are generally very complex and abstract , unlike that which happens with physics or biology teachers , who are generally happier about providing responses to student curiosity on cutting @-@ edge themes .
One example , she says , concerns the recent resolution of Poincaré 's Conjecture , a feat achieved by the Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman .
Formulated in 1900 by Jules Henry Poincaré , a Frenchman , it concerns a core issue of topology , an area of mathematics regarded as an extension of geometry and that studies the geometric properties that remain unchanged when objects are distorted , stretched or shrunken .
" Many teachers are embarrassed because they are unable to explain things to their students .
And topology is one of the areas that has advanced the most in the recent past , " she states .
In his writings , Klein challenged secondary school teachers to transmit to students the wealth of contemporary mathematics .
" My task will always be to show them the mutual connection between problems in a range of areas .
Thus , I hope to make it easier for them to acquire the skill to derive from the great mass of knowledge a living stimulus for instruction , " wrote Klein .
The project resorts to the same inspiration stated in Klein 's original texts , proposing this time to include the twentieth century research advances in the curricula .
The international project 's intent is to produce a book in understandable language that transmits the link , the growth and the relevance of mathematics , from its major ideas to the frontier of research and applications .
The twentieth century witnessed progress in several fields of mathematics that helped the appearance of new specializations , such as computer science and statistics , and that aided the development of technologies .
According to Mario Jorge Dias Carneiro , a professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and one of the project 's coordinators , the fields of probability and statistics are two striking examples of progress in research .
" Statistics is used in almost all areas and progressed substantially in the twentieth century .
The same can be said about probability , which is also part of our day @-@ to @-@ day life , " he states .
According to him , in the late twentieth century and early twenty @-@ first century , there was a lot of success employing probabilistic methods in the study of deterministic problems .
" This had made probability a very important theme , an almost central issue , in mathematics .
To learn probability properly , it is important to be familiar with counting methods , a topic that in basic education we call combinatory analysis , but this is covered very superficially in school , often becoming a very tough area for both students and teachers , " he explains .
Computer -- Marcelo Viana , from Impa , mentions another example : dynamic systems , a mathematical discipline that studies the types of phenomena that evolve over time .
The field , which is relatively new in mathematics , having arisen about one century ago , aimed to solve problems connected to astronomy and celestial mechanics , in an attempt to assess planets ' future behavior and predict whether they were going to crash into each other .
However , over the last few decades , an increasingly large number of phenomena are being regarded as a complex dynamic system , such as the climate , chemical reactions and ecological environments .
" Dynamic systems can help students develop concepts in various fields of knowledge , " says Viana , an expert on this subject .
Besides the content , there are other research aspects that the mathematicians would like to address , such as using computers in classrooms .
" It is an acknowledged fact that the use of computers for mathematical research was a landmark of the late twentieth century , but the incorporation of computers or even of calculators has not been consensually established in curricula , probably because it is desirable for the student to become properly familiar with the four operations and their properties , " comments Dias Carneiro .
According to Marcelo Viana , from Impa , the use of computers is still very limited and this could be used as a mathematical experiment laboratory .
The way in which the research is being conducted also steers away from the classroom , according to Dias Carneiro .
" The Internet allows us to develop scientific collaboration at a distance .
For a mathematician , it is essential to exchange ideas with other mathematicians .
If this was achieved at the beginning of the last century via letters and scientific meetings , now we are witnessing the development of joint scientific projects that are `open ' to collaboration .
This means that not only have the themes advanced , but the way in which mathematics is being produced changed significantly at the end of the century , " states the UFMG professor .
Terezinha Nunes , a senior professor at the Education Department at Oxford University , in England , states that the updating of the approach to mathematics in the classroom , as set forth in the Klein Project , is an excellent and very welcome initiative , but she admits that it will prove insufficient as a means of dealing with one of the major bottlenecks in the teaching of this subject , namely , people 's difficulty understanding some of the content .
" It isn 't enough to have a mathematics teacher with better training in the subject .
The teachers must also know how to teach mathematics and this includes an awareness of students ' difficulties , " states Terezinha , who focuses her research on the writing , reading and mathematics learning process .
The research into the process of teaching and learning mathematics is the target of mathematical education , another field of study that is quite well developed in Brazil .
As an example , she mentions learning fractions .
" Many teachers teach fractions following the same rationale used for integers , which causes huge confusion among the students .
It 's very common for students to say that one fifth is more than one third , because the number five in the denominator is greater than three , " she explains .
" It isn 't enough to use the allegory of pizza slices to teach fractions ; one must show that it is a relation between two numbers , a complex concept that many teachers avoid , " she states .
According to Terezinha , this type of problem is the subject of study not of mathematics , but of mathematical education , hence the fact that this cannot be solved by merely improving the training of teachers and by modernizing curricula .
The Klein Project may lack the scope to deal with all the problems of teaching mathematics , but initiatives of other scientific societies are trying to handle them .
One of these , headed by SBM , the Brazilian Society of Mathematics , is focusing on creating a professional distance master 's degree course geared toward improving the mathematics teacher training , with the backing of public institutions connected with the Ministry of Education 's Open University of Brazil .
The idea is to select one thousand teachers this very year in order to form an initial group that should graduate in March 2011 .
They will have a certain number of hours of distance training , as well as attending some lectures .
SBM is also engaged in re @-@ discussing the curriculum directives for mathematics teachers ' undergraduate courses .
" We have the obligation to hold this discussion in order to improve the undergraduate mathematics teachers ' course , " says Marcelo Viana .

Academics propose ways to put forest assets to better use
Carlos Fioravanti , de Manaus photos Fabio Colombini
X @-@ caboquinho , a sandwich often consumed in cafés and bakeries in Manaus in the afternoon , brings form and flavor to the impasse in the Amazon region .
It consists of a baguette @-@ like bread roll with slices of coalho cheese and slivers of tucumã , a fruit the size of a lime that has orange @-@ colored pulp .
When there is a shortage of tucumã in the city , the tradespeople have to look for it further and further afield and what they find may not be ideal for snacks , juices and ice creams .
José Alberto da Costa Machado , a professor at the Federal University of Amazonas ( Ufam ) , tells us that a team from CBA , the Amazon Region Biotechnology Center , developed tucumã clones that yield fruit after five years , whereas the current varieties are generally only productive after 10 years .
The problem is that CBA , created in 2002 with the mission of turning basic knowledge into applied knowledge , is not legally recognized .
Therefore , it cannot supply the seedlings that could help to maintain the supply of the ingredient for the late afternoon snacks .
" Iinstitutions in the Amazon region are rather precarious and this is a major problem , " says Costa Machado , who is working at CBA temporarily .
The book was the result of two tasks assigned to the three authors in 2007 by the then minister of Strategic Affairs , Roberto Mangabeira Unger .
The first was to turn the federal government 's strategic plan for the Amazon region into possibilities for action , taking into account two different realities , that of the east and the west of the region ( what Bertha Becker calls the deforested Amazon Region and the forested Amazon Region ) and the fact that the area is home to more than 20 million people and not only to a forest .
The second task was to find ways of bringing together the development @-@ oriented school , which promotes the limitless use of the land and its natural resources , and the radical environmentalist line , which sees the region as an " inviolable sanctuary , " to use the words of Messias da Costa .
The answer to the Amazon Region challenges , which the book describes in detail , may lie in applying the concept of environmental services , in which the conserved forest is seen as a source of riches that can be enjoyed with planning and without hurrying .
" Environmental services not only have economic value , but also strategic value , " ponders Bertha Becker .
The strategic value of nature " qualifies the natural capital of the Amazon Region as a component of power " for its " concentration of stock and services unequalled on the planet , " according to her .
" The protection of the forest core will result from using it innovatively and not by isolating it from production . "
High @-@ tech extraction -- The book 's three authors consider the need to go beyond the possibility of merely generating income from the intact forest by generating carbon credits to offset pollution in other countries .
Bertha regards the carbon market as a commodity , with a low and virtually fixed price , " with no added value , and repeating the primitive pattern that is characteristic of our country 's history . "
Building other environmental services , however , demands innovation in terms of institutions .
" The first and most urgent one is to establish a regulation framework that must be both clear and consistent with national and regional interests , " she argues .
Another challenge is to extend the benefits of the environmental services to the largest possible number of people .
As he sees it , there are three systems of productivity that express the development of sustainable exploration : foods , cosmetics and phytotherapeutic products .
According to him , the sector with the best performance is cosmetics -- perfumes , soaps , moisturizes and shampoos .
He believes that success in this area is due to cosmetics being free from the laws that regulate access to biodiversity and also because " Amazonia is a brand with global impact . "
In the cosmetics production chain in the Amazon Region , CBA is an institution that is better equipped and prepared to carry out full studies , from basic botanical research to the preparation of the end product , according to an analysis prepared by Alberto Cardoso Arruda , a professor at UFPA , and published in the July issue of the journal Parcerias Estratégicas .
Embrapa Amazônia Oriental stood out as an active institution that already makes andiroba soaps and shampoos .
Afloram , the Forests and Sustainable Business Agency , a now extinct Amazonas state enterprise , encouraged the setting up of new vegetable oil extraction plants -- the best @-@ sellers are those of copaiba , murumuru , buriti and andiroba , used in moisturizers , sunscreens and insect repellents .
" The local communities , organized as cooperatives , resent the lack of public policies to provide knowledge , technology and quality control for their products , not to speak of financing to aid the development of production chains , " says Arruda .
" The main copaiba oil @-@ producing communities can see that it 's a growing market , but find it difficult to meet demand , " observes Gonzalo Enriquez , a professor at UFPA who conducted another part of the study on the cosmetics chain .
Technological training is a serious bottleneck .
In the state of Acre , producers that are harvesting copaiba differentiate the species , without mixing them up .
" It 's progress , " he concluded .
" Instead of having imported energy drinks , youngsters could have guaraná extract , " he imagines .
" The Amazon Region needs short @-@ term actions firmly grounded in reality that can get us to win over new consumer markets and to open some space for other firms interested in the region 's opportunities . "
Dendê - Messias da Costa believes that this state of affairs will only change once three forces , or groups , start acting together .
The first comprises the local communities of producers or extractors , which need to be " organized in a modern way , as cooperatives , and run like formal companies . "
The second consists of small , medium or large businesses near consumption centers such as the cities of Manaus or Belém .
The third , which would have the role of linking communities and companies , concerns the researchers from government institutions such as Embrapa , Inpa ( the National Institute of Amazon Region Research ) , the Paranaense Emilio Goeldi Museum , the federal technical schools and the universities -- or even CBA , which Messias da Costa helped to create and which lost its direction after the failure of an agreement for bio @-@ prospection in the region with Novartis , the multinational pharmaceutical enterprise .
Even without any fine @-@ tuning of these connections , the forest assets are starting to be put to better use .
" The palm trees used to take four years to start producing , but now they produce within two years and yield a larger amount of oil per plant , " he says .
In another chapter , Francisco Costa shows that the economic activity already surrounding natural Amazon Region products is far greater and more dynamic that had been supposed .
Out of the six technological , rural @-@ based paths he uses to describe the rural evolution of the Amazon Region in the last 16 years , one , agricultural extraction based on small family properties , accounts for 21 % of the production value and for 26 % of jobs in the North Region 's rural sector .
" The rural @-@ based technological path is almost as important economically speaking as that based on cattle raising by farmers and by companies , which accounts for no more than 25 % of the value and 10.5 % of jobs . "
Costa found that the agricultural extraction path represents 3.5 % of the degraded area and 2.6 % of the net carbon balance , whereas livestock farming accounts for 70 % in both cases .
Both have a strategic significance when it comes to a sustainable development policy .
" The entire analysis of the six paths , with their different movements and relative autonomy , is an emphatic appeal to public policy to consider the diversity of structures and circumstances that form the Amazon Region today , " he states .
" I value quantification in order to determine , as precisely as possible , the diversity of the actors that are solving their production problems and forming institutions in stronger or weaker positions .
The public policy decision @-@ makers should pay more attention to these differences , without making linear decisions that put all the players on the same level . "
The book emphasizes the institutional aspects of formulating and implanting public policies in the Amazon Region , in particular those connected with government organizations .
The three authors of the book are familiar with the inner workings of the federal government .
Messias da Costa has been in and out of the federal government 's service since 1991 -- his latest position was director of programs and projects in the Amazon Region Bureau for five years ( 1995 @-@ 2000 ) .
Francisco Costa , from 2003 to 2005 , was the general coordinator of planning of ADA , the Amazon Region Development Agency , which succeeded Sudam , the Amazon Region Development Superintendence Bureau .
Fruit -- At ADA , Francisco Costa brought together producers , distributors , salespeople , researchers and other participants in the fruit complex or APL ( local production arrangement ) for fruits from Pará , northeast .
This APL represents the links among fruit producers and the pulp , juice and vegetable oil industry that has been growing , until now having become one of the chief items of trade with other states and countries , after mining , livestock farming and timber .
Meeting every month , the 22 representatives of companies , NGOs and government organizations that have accepted the ADA invitation " learnt what was going on with the others , voiced their problems , many of which were common , and tried to find solutions capable of helping everyone , " reports Costa .
He was in charge of ensuring that the " planning and actions of the state were as close as possible to those of the other players .
This experience showed that one can do things differently and provide instruments for regional development policies without changing operating structures already in place , " he observed .
At the end of March , Costa Machado completed the CBA business plan and master plan .
He felt it was necessary to debate them as soon as possible with those federal government employees who might be able to help the center to start working effectively , but he knows this will not be simple .
" There is a sort of refusal to industrialize the Amazon Region , which is disguised to a greater or lesser extent , " he says .
" It 's the idea that business and the Amazon Region don 't go together ; but it 's the opposite , without business , without generating income , there is no Amazon Region . "
" I find the lack of a strategic policy for the region very worrying , " Machado comments .
" In the last few years , the science and technology efforts had no unity or synergy ; they weren 't committed to a development project . "
At present , however , he sees little room for debating the possibility of producing other goods on an industrial scale in the Amazon Region .
In Manaus , traffic jams will tend to get worse as a result of the construction work needed for the city to host some of the 2014 Soccer World Cup matches .

A model program
Summary of the results of the first 10 years of Biota @-@ FAPESP published in Science
Marcos Pivetta
Biota @-@ FAPESP has released a review of its first 10 years in one of the best @-@ known international scientific journals .
In an article published in the North American journal Science on June 11 , seven Brazilian researchers summarized the main results achieved from 1999 to 2008 by the São Paulo program and highlighted the importance of the initiative for research , training people and formulating public policies in the area of biodiversity in São Paulo state .
Occupying a page and half in the " Policy Forum " section , the text also stressed that Biota has become a model for the introduction of similar projects in other states in Brazil and abroad .
" CNPq [ the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ] is planning a similar project and at the start of this year , the National Science Foundation [ of the United States ] launched its Dimensions of Biodiversity program , " said Carlos Joly , from the Institute of Biology at the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , coordinator of Biota and first author of the article .
" Between 2004 and 2006 , some of the coordinators of this program had a lot of contact with the work of Biota . "
For Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz , FAPESP 's scientific director , Biota is one of the Foundation 's most successful programs .
" Besides producing science of the highest quality , Biota has had a very significant impact on public conservation policies in the state of São Paulo and has been considered a model for other programs of the same type in Brazil and abroad . "
The figures achieved by the São Paulo program over the past 10 years are impressive .
About 1,200 researchers and students took part in 94 Biota projects , of which 20 are ongoing .
Most of the scientists were from the state of São Paulo , but at least 100 were from other states in Brazil and 80 from abroad .
More than 1,800 new species of fauna and flora were described and data about a further 12 , 000 species already known to science were collated and filed in 35 major biological collections that can be consulted online .
Since 2001 , the program has had an electronic journal , Biota Neotropica , which is listed in international databases .
Launched in 2002 , the BIOprospecTA initiative , which looks for new molecules in nature that might be of economic interest , has resulted in three patents .
One of these molecules is in the preclinical trials phase ( in vitro and in laboratory animals ) to investigate its potential for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease .
Besides producing a huge amount of technical information for use by other scientists , Biota had the excellet idea of preparing summaries of its most important data in the form of maps that can be easily understood by the authorities responsible for formulating environmental policy and the conservation of biodiversity .
Two of these maps on the priority regions for the restoration and conservation of biodiversity were adopted by the state of São Paulo as a legal parameter to guide its actions and directives in this field , including choosing new areas for conservation parks and units .
The draft of four government decrees and eleven resolutions in the environmental area contains specific references to information from Biota .
In the Science article , researchers also mention the points regarding which the performance of Biota , a program that is evaluated every two years by an independent international committee , went further than expected in its first decade .
According to Joly , these areas , which include the production of educational material for schools , the study of marine biology , the distribution of invasive species in the state of São Paulo and the human dimension of action in the conservation of biodiversity , will receive greater emphasis in the second phase of Biota , which may last as long as 10 years .
A good time for Brazilian science
Nature praises national research and highlights São Paulo 's autonomy and the strength of its production
Marcos Pivetta
A report published in the June 10 edition of the scientific journal Nature says that " Brazilian scientists have never seen better times . "
The reason is the federal government 's investments in the sector in recent years and the fact that many Brazilian states are " trying to emulate the rich [ state of ] São Paulo , which has the strongest scientific tradition " in the country .
Signed by journalist Anna Petherick , who covered the 4th National Conference on Science , Technology and Innovation , held in late May in Brasilia , the text stresses the benefits achieved by those states , such as São Paulo , that undertake to finance a considerable part of their research regardless of the volume of funding provided by Brasilia .
According to the article , in the early 1990s , when hyperinflation eroded the funds available for research , " the funding dried up in other places in the country , but researchers from São Paulo experienced fewer interruptions . "
In the report , Carlos Henrique de Brito Cruz , FAPESP 's scientific director , recalls that since the 1947 São Paulo State Constitution , the state has had its own laws ensuring the investment of a fixed percentage of its tax revenue for scientific research .
" Possibly no other research promotion agency in the world has this kind of security and financial autonomy [ from the federal government ] , " Brito Cruz told Nature .
The article by the journalist alludes to figures that illustrate the current strength of Brazilian science , such as the progressive increase in public investment in science , a process that , at the federal level , began with the term of president Fernando Henrique Cardoso and has continued during the two terms of his successor , Lula .
Another positive fact mentioned is the rising number of scientific articles published by Brazilian scientists in international journals .
As one of the great pieces of work done by Brazilian science , the report highlights the sequencing of the genome of the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium , the agent that causes citrus variegated chlorosis ( CVC ) in orange groves , an initiative concluded in 2000 and fully funded by FAPESP .

International dissemination
Aid for publications finances translations and encourages publishing houses to maintain scientific collections
FAPESP has released new rules for presenting proposals concerning Aid for Research - Publications , which partially funds the publication of periodicals , articles and books on the results of research conducted in São Paulo state .
One of the main innovations concerns the publication of books , which is to be divided into Books in Brazil and Books Abroad .
In the latter case , the Foundation proposes to fund the translation and technical review of the work .
" The new rule seeks to encourage the internationalization of the results of research carried out in São Paulo and the dissemination of São Paulo researchers ' work abroad , " said Luiz Henrique Lopes dos Santos , FAPESP 's assistant coordinator of Human and Social Sciences , Architecture , Economics and Management , and a professor at the Department of Philosophy at the School of Philosophy , Literature and Human Sciences at the University of São Paulo ( USP ) .
" There are subjects , especially in the humanities , in which producing works in other languages is more complex ; aid for translation aims at making them more visible and accessible , " he says .
The objective is to stimulate the creation of lines of titles linked to research at a larger number of publishers .
The need to produce distribution plans , another point introduced , is designed to ensure that the works are widely disseminated .
Requests for aid for the publication of periodicals , articles and books that explain the results of original research can be submitted at any time of the year by São Paulo researchers with a PhD or equivalent qualification .
Priority will be given to periodicals that meet the requirements for electronic publication as part of the SciELO project , an open @-@ access electronic library funded by FAPESP .
Articles , on the other hand , must be the result of research supported by FAPESP , to be published in international periodicals with a strict editorial policy .
Applications for the publication of works that are not the result of research supported by the Foundation will only be considered in exceptional cases .
The main researchers and those with FAPESP aid , as well as those who have been given FAPESP grants , under way and with a Technical Reserve , cannot apply for further aid for the publication of articles and should make use of the Technical Reserve .
If the article is written in collaboration with researchers from other states or from abroad , the support will be proportional to the contribution of the co @-@ authors from São Paulo .
In the case of books , they must carry original and unprecedented research results , preferably supported by FAPESP .
It is compulsory to present a letter of interest in the publication from at least one publishing house declaring it will be responsible for the project in the event of its approval by the Foundation .
The letter must include the total budget of the publication and the distribution plan .
Publications accepted by publishing houses that have a significant catalog of technical and scientific works are the ones which will be considered .
The quality of the works of the publishing house 's catalog will be taken into account in the proposal 's assessment .
Funding is always partial and will only be granted when the full cost of the publication by the university or commercial publishing house is not commercially justified .
As for books abroad , FAPESP only funds the translations and technical reviews of works in another language .
All other publishing costs are the responsibility of the publisher .

The battle for quality
Ibero @-@ American leaders , USP and Unicamp discuss how to increase the impact of their research
Two São Paulo institutions , the University of São Paulo ( USP ) and the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , and a Mexican institution , the Autonomous National University of Mexico ( Unam ) , lead the scientific productivity ranking in Latin America , the Caribbean and the Iberian Peninsula , as disclosed by the Spanish research group SCImago ( SIR 2010 ) .
The survey takes into account abstracts and references of some 17,000 periodicals from the Scopus database of the Elsevier publishing house .
From 2003 to 2008 , USP produced 38,000 scientific articles , Unam , 17,000 and Unicamp , 15,000 .
On the list of the 10 most productive universities , 5 are Spanish , 4 are Brazilian ( besides USP and Unicamp , Paulista State University / Unesp ranks sixth and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro / UFRJ , seventh ) and one Mexican university , Unam .
The ranking provides qualitative data .
One of the indicators is CCP , the Spanish acronym for Average Scientific Quality , which measures the scientific impact of an institution after eliminating the influence of its size .
Another index is Q1 , which shows the percentage of publications of the university that form part of the group comprising the most influential journals in the world , the 25 % best placed in a ranking of publications from SCIMago .
According to Marco Antonio Zago , Dean of Research at USP , these data are important because they show where the university has room for progress .
" USP has been increasing its contribution relative to the whole world , but my concern is with quality , which can improve , " he says .
In the case of CCP , USP had an index of 0.81 , which means that it is 19 % below the world average in quality .
In the case of Q1 , on the other hand , the university got 40.35 % of its publications into the group of most influential periodicals .
For comparison purposes , the University of Barcelona has a CCP of 1.41 and a Q1 of 62.16 .
According to Zago , there is a set of tools that can be used to improve impact and quality .
" We encourage our researchers , particularly the new professors , to present projects to FAPESP .
The Foundation has a process of analysis that is known to be good .
This is educational and shows researchers that the university expects them to have scientific production , " he says .
The scientific leaders at USP , says the Dean , already produce top quality work .
He analyses the impact of the articles published recently by 23 coordinators of thematic projects in the areas of medicine and biomedicine , who are linked to USP , and found that 437 of the pieces of work had 11,148 citations .
" The citation ratio of this group was exceptionally good , with 25.2 citations per article .
The average at Harvard University is 40 citations , " he said .
Unicamp faces the same challenge , with an Average Scientific Quality of 19 % below the world average and 38.18 % of the articles on the list of the most influential journals .
The Research Dean of the university , Ronaldo Pilli , says that one of his priorities is to increase the visibility of its research by encouraging the university 's researchers to publish in high impact journals .
" We do not expect to increase the number of researchers .
" We have figures in the order of 11 citations per work 10 years after publication , taking into account the production of all our researchers . "
Unicamp has encouraged the submission of projects to agencies , supported the hiring of young professors , with amounts as high as R $ 40,000 for the first two years , and encouraged hiring professors from abroad .
" This term , some 30 foreign visiting professors will take part in our graduate programs , " says Pilli .

Well @-@ regulated insulin and glucose
Physical activity and unsaturated fatty acids such as omega @-@ 3 revert inflammation that unleashes obesity and diabetes
Carlos Fioravanti
Now these recommendations have been finally understood : physical activity protects the region of the brain that regulates the appetite ; this is the region that is attacked by saturated fats , such as those found in a rump steak .
These findings have given rise to new possibilities of deterring obesity and diabetes , especially type 2 diabetes , in which the body produces insulin but does not use it adequately .
Part of this new information has come from a team at the Medical School of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) ; the team is coordinated by endocrinologist Mário Saad .
For many years , he and his team have studied the causes of organic imbalances that lead to obesity and diabetes .
Last year , Lício Velloso identified the specific cause of these diseases : excessive consumption of long @-@ chain saturated fats can generate an inflammation of the hunger @-@ controlling neurons of the hypothalamus , located just above the brain stem ( see Pesquisa FAPESP no . 156 , February 2009 ) .
The inflammation keeps the hormone insulin from working properly , which makes it easier to capture glucose in the cells .
Recently , Eduardo Ropelle has concluded that physical exercises not only burn calories -- as is widely known -- but also help to reduce the inflammation in the neurons of the hypothalamus and re @-@ establish satiety .
Ropelle transformed normal mice into obese ones by feeding them a diet high in saturated fats .
He then made some of the mice swim and run on a treadmill , while the other mice remained at rest .
The mice that exercised intensely produced anti @-@ inflammatory proteins known as interleukins ( in this case , two types : IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 10 ) , as described in detail in an article published this month in PLos Biology .
These interleukins reduced the inflammation in the neurons of the hypothalamus and the insulin started functioning normally .
The animals in this group started to eat less and to lose weight .
" Physical activity re @-@ established the molecular and cellular balance of the hypothalamus , " Ropelle concluded .
To check whether these two proteins actually had this effect , Ropelle applied IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 10 to the brains of the obese mice that had not exercised , whereupon they too lost weight .
Genetically modified mice , unable to produce these two types of interleukins , continued gaining weight , even if they swam or ran .
This study raises the possibility of controlling obesity and diabetes by interfering in inflammatory processes in the central nervous system , not necessarily by means of interleukins , which can weaken the body 's defense against disease @-@ causing microorganisms .
In their search for the deeper origins of insulin resistance , Velloso and Saad concluded that saturated fats bind with the cell membrane proteins , known as TLR @-@ 4 .
The receptors activate the enzymes that block the action of the insulin , keeping glucose from doing its job ( see Pesquisa FAPESP no . 140 , October 2007 ) .
" When it is activated , " says Velloso , " the TLR @-@ 4 cell receptor activates the inflammation and cell stress that can cause neuron death .
The consequence can be an imbalance in the number of neurons , if more hunger @-@ triggering neurons die than satiating neurons . "
Luckily , he adds , the omega @-@ 3 unsaturated fatty acids might have the opposite effect of the saturated fatty acids , blocking this inflammation instead of stimulating it .
This classification of fatty acids results from the number of chemical double bonds between their carbon atoms ; saturated fatty acids lack such double bonds , whereas unsaturated fatty acids have at least one .
The type of chemical bond determines the spatial structures ( saturated fatty acids are long , while unsaturated fatty acids are curved ) and their properties , such as the ability to interact with different molecules of the organism .
In Brazil , 6 million people have been diagnosed with diabetes and another 6 million might not even know they are diabetic because they have not been diagnosed as such .
According to recent data released by the Ministry of Health in June , nearly half of Brazil 's population is overweight or obese ; the numbers rose from 43 % in 2006 to 47 % in 2009 .
" Palmitic acid , a saturated fatty acid , activates the TLR @-@ 4 cell receptor and the inflammatory processes that lead to insulin resistance ; palmitoleic acid , an unsaturated fatty acid , produces the opposite effect and diminishes resistance to insulin , " points out Rui Curi , coordinator of a research group in this field at the Biomedical Sciences Institute ( ICB ) at the University of São Paulo ( SP ) .
Jarlei Fiamoncini , a member of Curi 's team , conducted an experiment that clearly showed this contrast .
Mice that had been put on a diet of unsaturated fatty acids from the omega @-@ 3 family ( eicosapentaenoic acid / EPA and docosahexaenoic acid / DHA ) , found in cold water fish such as salmon and codfish , proved to be more sensitive to insulin , normalizing the concentration of glucose in the blood .
Excess glucose in the blood can damage nerves and blood vessels .
In this experiment , in addition to normalizing glucose levels , the diet based on fish oil reduced the production of the enzymes that form fats from carbohydrates ( sugars ) .
As a result , the animals from this group gained less weight than the animals from the other group , which had been fed lard , which is high in saturated fatty acids .
" Saturated fats such as lard hinder the capturing of glucose and can induce insulin resistance , " he says .
The animals from the second group were hungrier , ate more , and gained weight .
Saturated or unsaturated fats can have opposite effects on muscle cells as well .
An excess of two types of saturated fatty acids -- palmitic acid and stearic acid -- jeopardized the functioning of lab @-@ grown muscle cells and hindered the action of insulin , while unsaturated oleic , linoleic , EPA , and DHA acids produced no changes in the functioning of the cells and let insulin act normally , according to studies conducted by Sandro Massao Hirabara , a professor at Cruzeiro do Sul University ( Unicsul ) .
" Omega @-@ 3 unsaturated fatty acids prevent insulin resistance induced by saturated fatty acids , " he states , based on research currently under way .
" No wonder the Japanese and the Eskimos , who eat a lot of fish high in omega @-@ 3 unsaturated fatty acids , have a lower incidence of heart problems , obesity and diabetes in comparison to other populations , " says Curi .
Therefore , it is probably a good idea to replace foods high in saturated fatty acids ( soybean oil , butter , animal fat ) by foods high in unsaturated fatty acids ( olive oil , linseed oil or sunflower oil ) .
Not all omegas -- even the unsaturated ones -- have the same effect on the organism .
Like the Roman god Janus , fatty acids , even those of the same type , are double @-@ faced and have opposite effects .
" Omega @-@ 3 unsaturated fatty acids reduce the inflammation that can lead to insulin resistance , whereas omega @-@ 6 unsaturated fatty acids can do the opposite " says Curi , referring to the Janus effect .
Fatty acids can help diabetics deal with one of the problems that affect them : the difficulty in wound healing , which leads even slight injuries to turn into chronic ones , says Elaine Hatanaka , from Unicsul .
Her team , together with colleagues from USP , studied the action of three fatty acids -- oleic , linoleic and linolenic acids -- on induced injuries in rats .
The three compounds speeded up the formation of scar tissue .
As an initial effect , the team stimulated the migration of neutrofiles - one type of blood cell -- to the injury .
" The effect of fatty acids can be different , depending on the type of cell , " says Elaine .
In addition , in a second stage in the process of wound healing , the same fatty acids acted inversely : they made the levels of cells and communicating proteins -- which had been momentarily high -- go back to normal .
" The fatty acids modulated the inflammatory response during the wound healing process , initially expanding the effect and number of neutrofiles and citokynes ( the proteins that facilitate cell interaction ) and then reducing them to normal levels , " Elaine comments .
The studies in this field explain the scar tissue effect of plant oils such as copaiba oil , which has high leic and linoleic acid content , and the ancient habit in traditional Chinese medicine of treating injuries with the extract of cricket glands , which is high in linoleic acid , as we now know .
A study on mice conducted at the Federal University of Paraná ( UFPR ) in Curitiba strengthened the possibility of using fatty acids -- especially unsaturated ones -- against cancer .
Luiz Claudio Fernandes and his team found that the aggressive Walker tumor grew much less in animals fed on a diet high in EPA and DHA unsaturated fatty acids than in animals that were not given an extra dose of lipids .
According to Fernandes , in the animals from the first group , the production of prostaglandin @-@ 3 , a compound derived from fatty acids that puts a brake on cell multiplication , increased and the tumor grew less .
In the other group , prostaglandin @-@ 2 , which triggers the multiplication of normal and tumor cells , rose .
Fernandes also noted less of one of the effects of cancer , cachexy , a condition characterized by loss of appetite and general physical wasting due to the high consumption of glucose by the tumors , among the mice treated with omega @-@ 3 lipids .
He believes that the human body might have similar reactions .
" When we place human tumor cells from the colon , lung , or prostate in a culture with omega @-@ 3 , the tumor 's proliferation rate drops , " he says .
" There are still few tests conducted on humans , but from what we have seen so far , the undesirable side effects of fatty acids are minimal : flatulence or diarrhea . "
At UFPR , the group coordinated by Anete Curte Ferraz found that omega @-@ 3 helps reduce depression in people with Parkinson 's disease or severe depression , according to a double @-@ blind study with 31 participants published in 2008 in the Journal of Affective Disorders .
In another study , researchers from the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) , from USP in Ribeirão Preto and from the University of Mogi das Cruzes ( UMC ) concluded that omega @-@ 3 can protect the neurons of the central nervous system and reduce the frequency of epileptic crises ( see Pesquisa FAPESP no . 169 , March 2010 ) .
In Finland , a study on 33 thousand women indicated another possible application of omega @-@ 3 and omega @-@ 6 unsaturated fatty acids , complemented with Vitamin D : the reduction of schizophrenics ' psychotic episodes .
These studies underscore the versatility of fatty acids .
However , one should not rush to the drugstore and buy fatty acids in the belief that they will make one as healthy as a child .
The benefits depend on the type of fatty acids and on the dose .
" Even unsaturated fatty acids like EPA and DHA in high doses , as found in parenteral diets [ intravenous feeding of people that cannot feed themselves orally ] can be toxic for blood cells , " says Maria Fernanda Cury Boaventura , from Unicsul .
In tests on healthy volunteers and patients in hospitals , Maria Fernanda and other researchers from USP found that excess levels of fatty acids in the blood -- as occurs in healthy people when they are fasting or in obese or diabetic people , and not only in patients who are in hospital and have just received parenteral nutrition -- can cause a small reduction in the number of lymphocytes , a type of defense cell .
The work done so far may motivate healthcare professionals to look for better treatment for patients under their care .
" Some hospitals already put patients on diets based on fish oil , but not to a great extent , " says Maria Fernanda .
" We have to specify the doses and the composition of the diets according to the patient .
Parenteral nutrition based on soybean oil -- the most common nutrition of this kind in the world -- can help weaken the body 's defense mechanisms -- in other words , it can act as an immunosuppressant ; this can be harmful to most hospitalized patients , but could be prescribed for transplant patients , for example .
" Curi adds : " We still don 't know how much fatty acid each kind of diet should contain , but we already know which fatty acids should be included and which should not be included in excess .
The important thing is how the combinations are prepared . "
Pure compounds are still very expensive , which is another reason for preferring combinations .
Pro @-@ inflammatory mechanisms involved in the hypothalamic control of hunger and thermogenesis -- no .

Autism connection
Neurons present chemical dysfunction linked to brain development
Marcos Pivetta
One of the most common neurological disturbances in newborns , autism is a disease whose origin is complex and that has challenged medical research for decades .
It is likely that environmental factors , such as exposure to heavy metals , pesticides or other toxic agents may play a part in the appearance of this troubling condition or in the increase of its symptoms .
However , most of the studies are trying to make progress in terms of understanding autism 's intricate genetic basis , as it might be caused by an as of yet unknown number of mutations and alterations in different genes of segments of the human genome .
A team of Brazilian researchers believes that they have found a clue to one of the mechanisms that might underlie the manifestation of this disease , characterized by repetitive behaviors and serious communication and social integration difficulties .
Using the baby teeth of a five @-@ year old autistic child seen to at the Center of Human Genome Studies at the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , one the Cepids ( Centers for Research , Innovation and Dissemination ) financed by FAPESP , the scientists obtained induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) and transformed them into neurons in their laboratory .
Thus , they managed to observe an important alteration in a given calcium channel whose sound functioning is extremely important in the early stages of the neuron development process .
" There is less calcium altering the activation of cell pathways that might be connected to the appearance of autism , in this case , " geneticist Maria Rita Passos Bueno , from USP , comments , one of the authors of the as yet unpublished study .
The neurons of autists also have different morphology than that of normal nervous cells , according to scientific literature .
They have a smaller nucleus and a smaller number of ramifications .
" This might mean that there is a problem of development or of maturing of the neurons , " states Muotri .
Although this condition has some symptoms that are similar to classic autism , it affects almost only girls and has a fairly precise cause : mutations in the MeCP2 gene of the X chromosome cause most of the cases of this disease .
This gene contains the instructions for the synthesis of a protein , also called MeCP2 , that is important for brain development and that works like a biochemical key for regulating other genes .
Anomalies affecting the production of this protein change the way in which other genes behave .
Coincidentally , in the case of the neurons derived from the iPSC of the Rett syndrome patients , the researchers found alterations in chemical pathways that also depend on calcium for their activation , a dysfunction similar to the one found in the Brazilian autistic patient .
" Perhaps the MeCP2 protein is important to regulate the calcium pathway , " says Muotri .
Chromosome rearrangement - At the current stage of these studies , it is impossible to say whether the calcium channel is involved in all cases of autism ( and of other similar neurological disorders ) or only in a small number of manifestations of the disease .
Concerning Rett 's syndrome specifically , the situation is simpler .
This disease 's genetic cause is known and animal models indicate that , if the levels of MeCP2 are normalized , the syndrome 's symptoms diminish .
When it comes to autism , however , the situation is more complex and nuanced .
There is no single gene or group of genes linked to the manifestation of the disease .
Certain genetic alterations connected with autism are known , but it is unknown how many more might exist .
The Brazilian child that supplied the baby teeth for the USP and UCSD teams to work on , for instance , developed autism because of a rare alteration involving segments of two chromosomes .
Still , " fewer than 5 % of autistic people have chromosome rearrangements , " says Karina .
At the Center of Human Genome Studies , the researchers characterized two other cases of autism due to this kind of genetic abnormality , one with a rearrangement of chromosomes X and 2 and another with changes in chromosomes 2 and 22 .
With the help of the researcher Matthew State from Yale University , Karina was able to precisely identify the point where the chromosomes of the three patients studied had a break .
Sometimes , this occurs in the middle of the sequence of a gene , which , once damaged , stops functioning .
If it is an important gene , this can cause problems .
" If we find more mutations or genetic rearrangements linked to autism and to problems in the activation of this calcium channel , then the hypothesis that this chemical pathway really is important for the disease to appear will become stronger , " says Maria Rita .
If this idea proves to be correct , the researchers may , in the future , investigate the effect of pharmaceutical products that act upon this chemical pathway in animal models with a condition similar to autism , or directly with human neurons , derived from iPSC cells .
" We can try to develop new compounds or even to test known molecules that are currently available in the inventory of drugs in biotechnology companies .
Using neurons derived from the iPSC of each patient for new drug trials is the first step toward personalized medical treatment , " states Muotri .

Good companions
Population density influences life span of termites
Francisco Bicudo
During fieldwork in the 1990s , Og de Souza needed to make a somewhat unusual purchase in São Gotardo , in Minas Gerais State .
Hastily entering one of the few stores in this city of 30,000 residents he asked for one thousand rolls of toilet paper , but not just any toilet paper .
The store assistant was surprised by the order , but Souza chose to leave him in the dark .
" If I 'd explained this , " he says , " he would never have believed me . "
Indeed , it is difficult to imagine that this paper would have a scientific use : bait to catch termites .
At the cost of a lot of toilet paper and painstaking work - it is often necessary to analyze the jaw or the shape of the digestive tract of insects to differentiate one species from another -- Souza has been helping clarify the function of termites in recycling carbon and the factors that lead these wood @-@ eating insects to choose their food sources in nature .
" Termites are a key species for the functioning of the ecosystem where they live and they can generate benefits for agriculture that more than offset the damage they cause , " said Souza , currently a researcher at the Federal University of Viçosa ( UFV ) in Minas Gerais .
Souza 's work also provides a possible answer to the so @-@ called Darwin dilemma , a paradox the English naturalist came up against in the nineteenth century while preparing his book , On the Origin of Species .
At that time , it was difficult to explain how an apparently disadvantageous situation could be favored by natural selection .
The reason that underlies many of the studies on animals that live in large complex societies , such as ants and bees , this dilemma , in the case of the almost 2,800 known species of termites , can be defined as follows : what would be the benefit of life in society if most of the individuals do not reproduce , since in each nest only the king and queen procreate and the workers and soldiers are sterile ?
In a partnership with the physicist Octávio Miramontes from the National Autonomous University of Mexico , Souza seems to have found an answer : life in society , for some reason not yet well understood , increases the life expectancy of insects .
Individually , sterile termites seem to lose out because they do not transmit their genetic characteristics directly to future generations .
However , they reproduce indirectly when they help their parents produce fertile siblings , with whom they share part of the genome - a gain that is leveraged further when they have a long life expectancy .
In the UFV Termitology Laboratory , Souza 's team conducted a series of experiments based on the assumption that there is a density of individuals that facilitates interaction between them and favors life in society .
Souza uses the example of a passenger on a bus .
If the bus is empty , the passenger has no one to talk to .
When the vehicle is crowded , the person cannot interact with all the others and smaller and fragmented relationship groups emerge .
Finally , in the so @-@ called ideal situation , there is a proportion of passengers that allows each one of them to exchange information with all the others .
" Our suspicion was that life in society , in groups where there is an appropriate density , would somehow allow the termites to live longer , " explains Souza , who calculates the ideal density by dividing the area that an individual occupies in a particular location by the total area available .
In the case of termites , this ratio is between 0.12 and 0.2 : together , all the termites occupy at most 20 % of the area .
In one of their first experiments , the group from Minas Gerais put the termites in test tubes with no access to food or water .
When the termites were isolated ( one insect in each tube ) , they survived for 100 hours at most .
In groups , however , each one could live up to 250 hours .
During the tests , the researchers observed no cannibalism , which could explain the longer life .
" At the time , we still didn 't know what the ideal density was , " he says .
" We adjusted this variable and considered the overpopulation scenarios of termites in the subsequent study , which confirmed the advantages of having an appropriate density [ a suitable number of individuals in a group ] . "
In another test , the researchers applied a drop of insecticide to each termite and separated the insects into three groups : one with few individuals , one with an ideal number , and a third that was overpopulated .
In the first and third groups , the maximum lifetime was 38 hours .
With a better sociable scenario , the termites survived for 46 hours -- 8 hours more than in the other groups .
Souza 's team is now investigating the factors that influence longevity .
" There are indications that social contact triggers enzymatic processes that , for a certain time , reduce the toxic potential of the venom , thus neutralizing the effect of the insecticide , " he says .
He believes that the influence of ideal sociability is long @-@ lasting and relevant , since it has been observed in situations of extreme stress , such as starvation and poisoning .
Natural contact - Although there are no known techniques for defining optimal density in termite mounds , Souza argues that it must exist in nature .
" There are indications that this grouping pattern occurs in almost everything , from robots to ants . "
The researcher from UFV also believes that in natural colonies the density oscillates around the optimum scenario the whole time .
At the same time , longevity is also advantageous for the sterile workers : the more termites there are , the greater the chance of siblings emerging which become kings and queens and pass on the genes of the sterile termites , thus resolving Darwin 's dilemma .
Also from this work come possible practical applications , such as defining the most appropriate time for destroying the termites that infest the closets of homes and apartments .
" If there is a greater tolerance to insecticides in groups with an ideal number of individuals , the most efficient thing would be to apply control measures when the population of the nest is above or below this density , " says Souza .
More recently , the researcher from Viçosa managed to answer another question that had intrigued him since he started studying termites in 1985 : in the natural environment , why do these insects infest some dead tree trunks and preserve others ?
In search of an explanation , Souza started another experiment in 2004 , on a piece of land next to his countryside property in Coimbra , southeast of Belo Horizonte .
He and biologist Ana Paula Albano Araújo , at the time his PhD student , spread rolls of toilet paper - pure cellulose , the main carbohydrate of plants and the source of energy for termites - on the ground .
On some of these rolls , they recorded the presence of ants , which are natural predators of termites .
The objective was to check if the presence of these threatening insects would have an influence on termites ' search for food .
In autumn , the beginning of the season of milder temperatures , the termites took on average 107 days to spread out to the larger rolls and 68 days to colonize the smaller rolls , when the paper contained ants .
Generally , the termites occupied rolls that were free of danger ( no ants ) faster and advanced more eagerly onto the larger rolls , which were taken over in just 42 days , as compared to 66 days to occupy the smaller ones .
In the summer , the experiment produced the same pattern .
The termites took 352 days to invade the smaller rolls that were also populated by ants and 224 days to occupy the larger ones .
Without ants close by , the termites acted faster .
Once again , they occupied the bigger rolls in 140 days , long before entirely taking over the smaller ones , which took 220 days .
In Souza 's assessment , termites seem to assess the cost benefit ratio .
" The limited availability of food is not worth the effort of colonizing a small area , " he explains .
They proved to be on the alert for predators , preferring lower risk areas .
Prospecting - Termites literally use their heads when it comes to choosing the wood they will consume .
They beat their heads against the block of wood and assess the vibrations produced , showed Theodore Evans , of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) of Australia , in his 2005 study in PNAS .
" Their heads function as a kind of sonar , " explains Souza .
In another study , conducted in an area of Atlantic Forest in Conceição da Barra , in Espírito Santo , Souza and the biologist , Fernanda Sguizzatto de Araújo saw that , in addition to liking big trees , termites prefer dead ones .
According to the work , published this year in Sociobiology , the likelihood of there being termite galleries in dead trees with trunks 40 cm or more in diameter exceeded 50 % .
The same percentage of infestation was only observed in live trees with trunks whose diameter was at least 80 cm .
Trees that have already died can be completely eaten , whereas in living trees the termites only manage to attack the bark .
" Once again the availability of food seems to influence the choice , " adds Souza .
In developing this work , Souza was able to explain in more detail the role of termites in the carbon cycle , which enters into the composition of atmospheric gases and the organic matter that constitutes plants and animals .
Once dead , decaying trunks mix with the soil to form humus , which is digested by bacteria .
It is a slow process ( it is calculated that a large trunk takes 50 to 100 years to be consumed only by these microorganisms ) , but termites can speed this up .
They consume the cellulose available in the soil , digest it and then release carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , according to a 2009 article in the Bulletin of Entomological Research .
The action of termites in the degradation of cellulose can be easily observed by the color of the soil .
It is lighter when the colonies are efficient in processing the humus and dark brown in termite @-@ free areas .
As the humus contains water and other nutrients besides cellulose , it is interesting that termites do not consume it completely .
At the same time , processing by termites allows the carbon to return to the plants as CO2 , as Souza explains .
This balance is important for agriculture .
" The Kayapó Indians know this very well and use pieces of termite mound as fertilizer in the trenches in which they plant yams and sweet potatoes , " says the researcher .
More recently , he has been focusing on analyzing another curious feature of termite colonies : the harmonious coexistence of many different species of these insects .
There are records of more than 1,500 species of insects living in termite nests .
There are also seven different genera of termites inhabiting the same nest , apparently without conflict .
The secret of peaceful contact seems to be determined by the stomach .
" The species have varied diets and do not compete for food , " says Souza .
He also suspects that individuals of species different from the one that colonized the termite nest often manage to go unnoticed , thanks to a chemical camouflage : a compound released by the cuticle ( the layer covering the skeleton of insects ) , which is capable of deceiving the owners of the condominium .
In this year 's article in PLoS Biology , researchers from Harvard University , in the United States , showed that the diversity of species exists not only in the tunnels of the termite mounds : where there are termites , there is also greater plant and animal diversity .
" Termites , " Souza states , " are extremely important for maintaining biodiversity and the ecological balance of a particular region . "

The last piece of Gondwana
The ancient ocean that isolated the Amazon from other blocks in South America dried up 520 million years ago
Marcos Pivetta
The chronological history of Gondwana , the ancient southern super @-@ continent that included most of the land now located in the Southern Hemisphere , is being rewritten by Brazilian and North American researchers .
According to new rock dating and analyses of the magnetic field in segments of a chain of mountains in Central Brazil , the final event that created the super @-@ continent occurred 100 million years later than was thought .
The disappearance of an ocean , Clymene , that separated the Amazon from the other blocks of the future South America , took place 520 million years ago .
" Before , we worked with the idea that Clymene had closed about 620 million years ago , " said the geologist Ricardo Trindade , from the Institute of Astronomy , Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of São Paulo ( IAG @-@ USP ) , one of the authors of the article published in the March issue of the journal Geology .
" Now we know that the Amazon Region spent a lot of time separated from the other segments of South America and from the rest of Gondwana by this ocean . "
The existence of this inland sea , splitting the heart of ancient Brazil , is one of the proposals put forth by this group of researchers .
Its name was taken from Greek mythology .
Clymene was the wife of Iapetus , a Titan .
The ocean was so called to emphasize its connection with another ocean , the great Lapetus , which bathed the Southern Hemisphere at the same time .
The junction of the original fragments of South America left marks on the relief of the land in the form of elevations that are visible to this day .
The detailed study of the features of one of these geological scars , the Paraguay Fold Belt , led the researchers to establish a new date for the end of the assembly process of Gondwana .
The Paraguay Fold Belt is a group of elevations that marks the collision zone , or suture , in the jargon of geologists , between the biggest of the South American blocks , the Amazon , and the other parts of the continent .
Strictly speaking , it is part of an enormous mountain chain that extends from the border of Maranhão and Pará , passing through Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul , right to the south of Argentina .
" It 's striking that these mountains form a curve , " comments the North American geologist Eric Tohver , from the University of Western Australia , another person responsible for the work .
" In Mato Grosso , the direction of the chain is west to east .
From Mato Grosso do Sul to Paraguay it 's north to south . "
With funding from FAPESP and the National Science Foundation in the United States , Tohver took part in the study for three years while he was doing post @-@ doctoral studies at USP with Trindade and Cláudio Riccomini 's team .
The age of the mountains in the Paraguay Fold Belt , of which the Serra das Araras in Mato Grosso forms part , was determined by dating the clay at the bottom of the ancient ocean , Clymene .
Using a variation of the technique normally employed for calculating the age of certain types of geological faults and earthquakes , the method measures the quantity of isotopes of argon ( 40Ar and 39Ar ) in the rocks .
The results suggest that the formation of the mountains -- and , therefore , the closing off of the Clymene ocean -- having occurred about 520 million years ago , i.e. , 100 million years later than was thought .
The second analysis used for justifying this conclusion concerns the direction and intensity of the earth 's magnetic field stored in the minerals found in the rocks and sediment of these mountains .
These materials have something like a compass embedded inside them , a sign that allows one to deduce where the magnetic poles were at a given moment in the evolutionary history of the planet and supplies clues to the movement of the continents in the remote past .
In the case of the sample from the Paraguay Fold Belt , studies indicate that the non @-@ rectilinear conformation of the mountain chain is compatible with the paleomagnetic records filed away in its minerals .
" The magnetic vectors follow the curve of the mountains , " says Tohver .
Analyses also show that once the chain was , in fact , straight , but that then it was folded by a rotating movement around a vertical axis .
This type of adjustment commonly occurs in places where there was a shock and a settlement of ancient blocks of earth , as happened in Central Brazil when Clymene disappeared .
Until the 1980s , the dominant idea was that Gondwana acquired its final outlines at one go .
All the constituent pieces of the southern super @-@ continent , ancient and relatively stable parts of the continental crust , called cratons by geologists , were assumed to have slotted into one another at approximately the same time .
Over the last few decades , the hypothesis has gained strength that the birth of the super @-@ continent was less of a one @-@ off process and that its final act occurred precisely in the center of Brazil , where not all the pieces of this geological jigsaw puzzle had found the right point to fit in .
According to this new model , unlike the rest of Gondwana , whose parts were already joined and adjusted , a little more than a half billion years ago South America was still fractioned into blocks .
The Amazon , São Francisco ( linked to Africa ) , Rio Apa , Paraná , Luís Alves and Rio da Prata cratons existed .
With the exception of the Andes , which were yet to be formed , the main parts of our continent were close to each other , but still separated by Clymene ( see table ) .
The ocean had to close up so that the blocks of land could finally fit together .
This was the final movement in assembling Gondwana , which included pieces of the current South America , Africa , Oceania , Antarctica , India and the Arabian Peninsula .

Hitching a ride in steam
Interaction of water with rocks facilitated the accumulation of copper and the formation of amethysts
Carlos Fioravanti
In the depths of the Guarani aquifer , the underground reservoir that supplies the cities of the southeast and south of Brazil , the water temperature is unlikely to exceed 60o Celsius .
However , this water was once far hotter , to the point of changing the composition of the rocks that cover the aquifer forming copper spheres and amethyst deposits as it rose to the surface .
A team from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) concluded that the water of the Guarani aquifer must have reached 130oC around 135 million years ago , when carnivorous dinosaurs ran after herbivorous dinosaurs in the probably barren plains of the south and southeast of Brazil .
Analyses of rocks have indicated that the water must have boiled and remained as steam for 1 or 2 million years , while a part of the liquid magma came out of the Tristão da Cunha plume , which heated the entire south and southeast region of South America , and settled in the middle of the layer of already crystallized basalt .
The water steam must have crossed the basalt , released the copper atoms from the minerals and carried them to the spherical cavities and fractures in which the copper accumulated .
Likewise , the water vapor , in releasing , transporting and accumulating minerals while it moved away from the center of the earth , may have aided the formation of deposits of amethyst , a variety of quartz that is violet in color because of impurities , like manganese or iron , in the south of the country .
With this hypothesis , older concepts about the formation of these minerals are scuppered .
" The copper and amethyst deposits of this region , the Paraná volcanic province , must have been formed at 150oC at the most , as a result of the interaction of the water and steam with the basalts , and not at 1200oC , as a consequence of the cooling of the basaltic lava , as was thought , " says the geologist Léo Afraneo Hartmann , a professor at UFRGS and coordinator of the team that for five years has been examining variations in the composition of the rocks that cover the aquifer .
This layer , known geologically as the Serra Geral Group , comes to the surface in the south of Minas Gerais , then spreads out at depths that reach 1,800 meters in the states of São Paulo and Paraná and rises to 800 meters below the surface in Rio Grande do Sul .
" All the tests are confirming this new hypothesis . "
For two years , while doing his PhD with Hartmann as his tutor , Víter Magalhães Pinto collected samples of copper as much as 3 meters below the surface in 85 locations in the Vista Alegre district , on the border between Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina .
His purpose was to understand why the copper there , instead of being in deposits , as in other regions in Brazil , forms spheres with low impurity , whose dimensions vary from half the size of a closed adult fist to 200 kg , weighing between 500 grams and 200 kg .
At UFRGS and in Australia , where he did part of his PhD , Víter analyzed the succession of minerals accumulated in these cavities and cracks .
" The copper was the last deposit phase of minerals in the rock cavities , " concluded Víter , hired in January as a professor at the Federal University of Roraima .
Therefore , he thought , the copper must be more recent than the other minerals and must have been removed from the minerals , pyroxene and magnetite , which make up the basalts , by steam .
Detailed in an article about to be published in the International Geology Review , these findings converged with the PhD research of Lauren Duarte , conducted under Hartmann 's supervision as well .
" Two theoretical physicists , professors Marcos Vanconcelos and Joacir Medeiros , who were here from UFRGS , helped us a lot with the mathematical modeling of the temperature and water pressure , which explained what we saw in the field , " reported Lauren , hired last year as a professor at UFRGS .
Since 2008 , she has been part of the team from a laboratory that develops technologies that could lead to making the most , in economic terms , of waste from minerals and gems , like agate and amethyst .
Water from gold - " In the Serra Geral there is still hot water today , although not as hot as before , and it 's still passing through the rocks that cover the aquifer , " says Hartmann .
The waters that reach the thermal spa of Iraí , in the north of Rio Grande do Sul , are warm and in some towns in São Paulo have dissolved silica in them .
For two decades , Hartmann and his team examined how the water , combined with sulfur and chlorine at temperatures higher than 150oC , facilitated the formation of gold deposits in the Amazon Region , in Uruguay and in the Andes .
Supported by funding from CNPq ( the National Scientific and Technological Development Council ] ) and Fapergs ( the Rio Grande do Sul State Research Funding Agency ) , Hartmann continues going into the field with his team .
Hartmann also believes that copper may have formed deposits along the Serra Geral , and not just small and few and far between deposits .
" In China they 've already found and are mining copper with similar origins , " he says .
" The indications we 've seen so far in the south of Brazil are signs that there may be a deposit , but it 's only by systematically looking for it that we 'll know for sure . "

Enigmatic attraction
New theory helps explain the behavior of ions diluted in water
Salvador Nogueira
When Isaac Newton was inspired by a falling apple to draw up his Law of Gravity , the English physicist and mathematician was fairly confident that this phenomenon always happened in the same way : the apple would fall downward , toward the center of the Earth .
How surprised would Newton be if , now and again , the fruit were to fall upwards , for example ?
The surprise he would probably express would perhaps be similar to that of researchers who are trying to understand the behavior of electrically charged particles ( ions ) diluted in water in the microscopic world .
The almost 100 year @-@ old theory on the interactions of these particles suggests that they should always remain distant from the region where the water meets the air , the so @-@ called water @-@ air interface .
However , laboratory experiments and computer @-@ simulations have shown that this does happen with certain ions , especially those with a negative electrical charge , which seem attracted to this region .
After a century , the mystery is finally beginning to be cleared up , thanks to a new theory developed under the guidance of the American @-@ Brazilian physicist Yan Levin , a researcher at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) .
In work published at the end of 2009 in the prestigious scientific journal Physical Review Letters , Levin and his group showed that it is possible to re @-@ establish the theoretical forecast capacity of the behavior of these particles if researchers stop treating them in a simplistic and practical way as spheres with a positive or negative charge located at their center .
By considering them as small spheres with a central electrical charge , the theoreticians managed to predict a varied range of behaviors of these particles .
However , certain enigmas remained , such as the selective attraction to the water ´ s surface .
In nature , however , the ions are not rigid spheres like billiard balls .
They obey the quantum theory rules , the physics of the sub @-@ microscopic world that often contradicts intuition .
What does this mean ?
It means that they behave as if they were a diffuse cloud around the atom or the molecule .
Anyone who tries to measure the position of an electron will have more chance of finding it in a certain region in the cloud .
However , it is only possible to define precisely where it is when it is , in fact , observed .
Before measurement it is as if it were in every possible place at the same time -- that is why physicists say that the electron is a wave of probability .
However , these details should not bother us , since so far the researchers who work with quantum physics do not know how to interpret what the theory really means concerning the nature of particles and the world at its smallest scale .
Despite being difficult to understand , quantum physics represents what happens in the world of particles with a fair degree of precision .
Using quantum physics , one can calculate waves of probability that adjust perfectly to the results obtained in experiments .
The interpretation of what happens with ions at the water @-@ air interface began to change when Yan Levin decided to check what would happen if he considered that , instead of being located in the center of the ion as was imagined , the charge was distributed in an unequal way on the surface of the ion -- an effect known as polarizability .
This unequal distribution is produced by the electrical field generated by the molecules of water : each hydrogen atom of a molecule has a positive charge and is connected to the oxygen of another by a negative charge , creating chemical bonds ( hydrogen bridges ) .
Ions disturb these bonds , generating competition between the two effects .
Compatible numbers -- In the case of large and highly polarizable ions , the hydrogen bridges prevail and push these ions to the water @-@ air interface , the opposite of what the former theories forecast , explains Levin .
It was precisely this that he observed in the laboratory experiments , particularly with negative ions produced by dissolving salts containing chemical halogen elements ( chlorine , bromine , iodine and fluorine ) .
The theoretical calculations produced by Levin and his colleagues correspond perfectly to the experimental observations .
They have already counted the ions produced by these salts at the water @-@ air interface and now intend working with acids to see if the effect is similar .
Over the next few months , the group also plans to look into the effect of salt solutions in their interaction with proteins .
It is known that in the case of proteins diluted in water , the behavior of molecules at the water @-@ air interface may be very similar to what happens at the interface between water and oil or water and air .
This is important in order to understand why certain salts cause the precipitation ( and others the stability ) of proteins , the molecules responsible for practically everything that happens in the metabolism of living beings .
In Levin 's opinion , if his equations prove to be correct , they may be applied in very different situations .
It is possible , for example , that they may further the understanding of certain nuances of life 's evolution on Earth .
" There were moments in the history of the planet when mass extinction occurred in the oceans , which may have happened because of the decrease of ions in the seas , " he recalls .
" With the new theory , we shall also be able to investigate the limit before proteins are precipitated because of the salt . "
Another phenomenon that can be explained by this new theory is the degradation of ozone in the lower atmosphere .
It is believed that close to the surface of the oceans , droplets ( aerosols ) of water help to destroy this gas -- and therefore to diminish its concentration .
According to the previous theory on the behavior of ions , ozone degradation in these regions occurs at much lower rates than observed in reality .
Levin believes that in this case the theory proposed by his group also produces results that are closer to those obtained experimentally .

Stored electricity
Company develops a battery for electric vehicles and solar and wind systems
Marcos de Oliveira
These generators emit no pollutants , work quietly with no vibration , and can be either stationary in a residence , business or event , or can generate power inside a vehicle .
The company has already sold about 75 of these cells , mostly to companies and research institutions , with the idea of demonstrating this still experimental technology that is evolving everywhere in the world .
Electrocell batteries are made up of bipolar graphite plates for use in vehicles and also for storing power in renewable energy systems , such as those based on solar and wind power .
" They are suitable for entirely electric vehicles , mainly buses and trucks in market niches , such as mail services , power companies , delivery companies and golf carts , for example , " says engineer Gerhard Ett , a researcher and Electrocell partner .
" Our battery was designed to supply power systems cheaply .
It stores power after being recharged in a socket , in the case of vehicles , or with the power generated in solar panels during the day , or even by wind @-@ powered generators . "
" Our bipolar batteries can cost 15 % to 25 % of the price of lithium ion batteries , the most widely used in cutting @-@ edge equipment , from vehicles to cell phones , " says engineer Gilberto Janólio , another of Electrocell 's partner @-@ researchers .
" Lithium batteries are unbeatable in terms of the power density they can store , but the cost and duration of our battery makes them worthwhile , " says Ett .
Inspiration for the batteries came from industrial lead @-@ acid batteries , used , for example , by telephone exchanges for a few hours when their power supply system fails .
Batteries such as these are also fitted in the small electric vehicles used in football stadiums for removing injured players from the field or on golf courses and at events .
" Our batteries have far less lead than traditional batteries and last much longer , " says Ett .
The research conducted at the company resulted in thin layers of lead oxide being applied to the graphite plates .
" This is an evolution of lead batteries ; it 's material that 's 100 % recyclable and reusable , and meets European environmental standards , " says Janólio .
To develop the battery , researchers from the São Paulo company used bipolar graphite plates used in fuel cells , which conduct and distribute the hydrogen inside the equipment .
They also make the link between the polymer membrane assembly for the exchange of protons and the electrodes , known as the membrane electrode assembly ( MEA ) .
In the battery , the graphite plates have a thin layer of lead and some additives and , as in the cells , they form a single set .
" The use of the cell concept in the battery is unprecedented , " says Ett .
" Today , each plate costs â  ¬ 20 , whereas the one we make goes for R $ 2 , " says the researcher .
The new battery concept lasts for 1,000 charging cycles .
Each cycle means the battery discharges fully and then recharges ; this can be done 1,000 times , while traditional automotive lead batteries only get to 100 cycles .
" The energy expended by our battery is 60 watt @-@ hours ( Wh ) per kilo , versus the 85 Wh of the lithium battery , " says Janólio .
The cost of the Electrocell battery to future customers is US $ 200 per kilowatt @-@ hour ( kWh ) , while lithium batteries cost US $ 600 to US $ 1200 , according to figures from the international market collected by the company .
The new battery has already had its patent accepted by the Patent Cooperation Treaty ( PCT ) , which allows this document to be deposited in hundreds of countries .
" We already had the patent of the plates for the fuel cells and now we have deposited it widely , worldwide , " says Ett .
" We want to go into the international market and we 're negotiating the license of the patent with several companies in Brazil and abroad .
This is a lengthy process and we need to be careful , " he says .
Funding for the research into the new battery came from the cash flow of Electrocell itself , which is an incubated company that was established at the Center for Innovation , Entrepreneurship and Technology ( Cietec ) and is now operating in the Pre @-@ Technology Park on the Cidade Universitária campus .
" But we had the support of FAPESP in developing the graphite plates for the cells , which contributed to the creation of the battery , " says Ett .
The project was carried out between 2004 and 2008 and is part of the Innovative Research in Small Companies ( PIPE ) program .
One that is in the project stage is intended for hybrid alcohol @-@ powered vehicles ; it would be used in the same automobile alongside a dual fuel engine and electric batteries , which still provide only a few kilometers ( km ) of autonomy .
Fuel cells are also an option for inclusion in vehicles that can be plugged into a socket for refueling and obtaining more autonomy with hydrogen .
Likewise , a small petrol or alcohol engine can supply the vehicle with enough power to run well over 100 km .
" The autonomy provided by alcohol , gasoline and diesel is very high as compared to purely electric vehicles with only one battery offer . "
Hydrogen cells are in an intermediate position , but rank first when it comes to low emission of pollutants .
The only waste from the cells is water vapor .
One obstacle to the greater use of cells is their high cost , although prices have fallen .
There are forecasts for 2013 indicating that prices will drop by as much as 90 % relative to 2003 figures , according to Nucellsys , of the German Daimler Group , the parent company of Mercedes @-@ Benz , which develops and produces cells .
Prices may fall as the study of materials progresses and with economies of scale .
" Renewable energy will be slightly more expensive and will not have , at least in the short and medium term , the same cost as conventional energy .
Electrocell itself sets its price based on quantity .
" Fifty 5 @-@ kilowatt ( kW ) cells cost US $ 6,000 a kW .
Larger , 50 @-@ kW cells , also in 50 units , sell for US $ 5,000 a kW , " says Ett .
Individual cells , of course , cost much more .
The biggest ones that the company has made so far were public entities or those which also had government financing , such as Eletrobras and , the biggest of all , the one for the Coppe bus , with 77 kW ( see article on page 72 ) .
Another 50 kW unit , for use as a generator , was produced for AES Eletropaulo , with government incentives ( see Pesquisa FAPESP No. 93 ) .

Itaipu Binacional produces electric vehicles in a partnership with Fiat and Swiss companies
The first electric car developed in Brazil by a vehicle manufacturer appeared in 1974 .
It was the Itaipu E @-@ 150 prototype with two seats , from Gurgel , a company based in Rio Claro in São Paulo state , headed up by the engineer João Augusto do Amaral Gurgel .
Later , in 1981 , the factory presented the Itaipu E @-@ 400 and soon thereafter the E @-@ 500 , a multiuse platform for pickups and vans that sold a few dozen units and was unsuccessful due to problems with the rechargeable batteries that had a very short working life .
The name Itaipu was chosen in honor of the biggest hydroelectric power station in Brazil , on the Parana River on the border with Paraguay .
It is there that electric cars are now being developed in a partnership between Itaipu Binacional , the Swiss hydroelectric power company Kraftwerk Oberhasli ( KWO ) and Fiat .
" We 've already assembled 45 vehicles , including automobiles , small trucks and a minibus , " says Celso Novais , general coordinator of the Brazilian Electric Vehicle Project of Itaipu .
" We started in 2005 with a technical cooperation partnership agreement for the production of hydroelectricity and KWO suggested we establish a research project for the development and production of electric vehicles , starting from technology that exists in Switzerland , " says Novais .
The batteries come from Mes @-@ Dea and , in addition to nickel , their main element is sodium chloride .
" These batteries are operationally more viable in tropical countries because they use abundant raw materials that are easy to recycle . "
The automobiles are the Palio Weekend model and they were assembled at the Itaipu Center for Research , Development and the Assembly of Electric Vehicles .
They have no combustion engine or gearbox and the main components added were the 160 kg sodium battery , control modules , a special electric motor for powering the car , a socket for recharging the battery in place of the traditional fuel tank inlet and an electric charge indicator on the panel .
The vehicles are undergoing trials and may , in the future , become part of the Fiat production line .
" The problem with electric vehicles is their cost , which is two and half times greater than the cost of a conventional car , because the batteries represent 50 % of the car 's total value , " says Novais .
For this reason , Itaipu has already contacted KWO itself as well as other companies in order to make it feasible to develop batteries in Brazil , as a cheaper and more competitive alternative .
As for the cost per kilometer traveled , he says it is about four times lower than with gasoline .
For energy companies the difference is greater because they use their own raw material .
The autonomy of the Itaipu vehicles is 120 km .
The time required to recharge a fully discharged battery is eight hours , with the car plugged into a 220 @-@ volt socket .
" Every day around the world , 90 % of automobiles spend about 12 hours parked in their garages , " says Novais .
He has carried out an impact study on the use of electric vehicles relative to energy production in the country .
" If all the cars produced in 2008 in Brazil ( 3 million ) had been electric , the total power consumed that year would have increased by 3.2 % . "

Environmental bus
Coppe builds a vehicle driven by hydrogen and batteries
Marcos de Oliveira
Urban buses in big cities are essential both to serve the population and to reduce the number of cars on the streets , if the service is of good quality .
However , buses are also a means of transport that , because of their powerful diesel engines , produce a considerable level of gas emissions that harm the environment .
The solution to the problem is known and consists of using vehicles that produce fewer pollutants , such as those that run on ethanol , or no pollutants at all , with hydrogen or electricity .
Projects along these lines are under development in various parts of the world and Brazil already has a hybrid prototype , powered by hydrogen and energy @-@ accumulator batteries that were developed in the country .
It is an apparently conventional bus for 29 seated and 40 standing passengers , designed and built over five years by the Hydrogen Laboratory ( LabH2 ) of the Alberto Luiz Coimbra Institute for Graduate Studies and Research in Engineering ( Coppe ) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) .
" The hydrogen buses developed so far , such as the European Cute project , had large , very expensive fuel cells that consumed a lot of hydrogen .
The evolution is carrying out hybridization projects with a fuel cell that produces energy for rechargeable lithium ion batteries , similar to those in cell phones , but much larger and suitable for vehicle traction , which make the electric motor work and propel the bus , " says Paulo Emílio Valadão de Miranda , a professor from Coppe and the project 's coordinator .
Cute is the Clean Urban Transport for Europe project , financed by the European Union and consisting of 28 buses that have been circulating in several European cities since 2004 .
Fuel cells , the name preferred by Professor Miranda , is equipment that generates power through an electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen from the air .
They work on the Coppe bus as a generator within the vehicle , powering the batteries , which provide autonomy of just over 100 kilometers , when fully charged for four hours at night from a special socket installed in the garages of the public transport company .
" The cell starts working when the battery charge reaches a level predetermined by the main control system , " says Miranda .
With this cell , the bus can run about 300 km in all without having to be recharged .
" It 's the transformation of the kinetic energy from the brakes into electricity , " says Miranda .
To control all these energy flows and make them work in the most economical and efficient way , Miranda 's team developed an intelligent electronic bus system that manages the energy on board .
Industrial partners - Besides Electrocell and WEG , Coppe has a technical partnership with other industries such as Busscar , from Joinville , in Santa Catarina , which supplied the chassis and the body , Rotarex , from Mogi Guaçu , in the state of São Paulo , a manufacturer of valves and connections for gases , and a further four companies from Rio de Janeiro , EnergiaH , with its electric traction systems , Energysat , which makes control equipment , Controllato , analysis and solutions for the vibrations to which the equipment is subject within the vehicle , and Guardian , which makes electronic components .
Initial funding for the project came from Petrobras and the Studies and Projects Funding Agency ( Finep ) , by means of sector funds in the amount of R $ 2 million .
" This is 30 % of the total investment made [ about R $ 7 million ] , including the added value from the partnerships that invested not only money , but also equipment , engineers and labor for building the bus . "
In the second half of this year , the bus will start running on the UFRJ campus , on Fundão Island in Rio de Janeiro .
Then , under the coordination of the Municipal Department of Transport and Fetransport ( the Federation of Passenger Transport Companies of the State of Rio de Janeiro ) it will be included on a conventional urban bus route in the city .
The idea is to build this bus commercially in Brazil after the trials and the final adjustments .
" There is an agreement between the industrial and commercial partners to make it feasible to produce this bus , " says Miranda .
The initial idea is to have them in the Rio city bus fleet for the 2014 Soccer World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games .
Another experiment with hydrogen buses is being carried out in São Paulo by EMTU ( the city 's Metropolitan Urban Transport Company ) , in a project financed by the World Bank ( see story in Pesquisa FAPESP no.160 ) .
The next LABH2 technological steps will be to produce two more buses .
One will be a hybrid as well , but instead of the fuel cell , it will carry an ethanol generator to power the lithium ion batteries that supply electricity for the bus to run .
The third in the series will be an all @-@ electric bus that will cover about 200 km without needing to recharge the socket in the garage .
" In Rio , it must be able to cover about 240 km a day , on average , " says Miranda .
In Rio de Janeiro , there are 9,000 public buses and in the state there are 17,000 .
Changing the engines that drive these vehicles , or parts of them , would have a major environmental impact .
The buses that run on hydrogen only release water vapor and electric buses emit nothing .
Moreover , they are extremely silent , which also counts for points against noise pollution in large cities .

Now made in Brazil
First stent produced Brazil to correct narrowed arteries has a market
Yuri Vasconcelos
Some 800 Brazilians already have in their chests the first stent fully designed and manufactured in the country .
The metal device , used for treating cardiac patients with narrowing of the heart arteries , was developed by Innovatech Medical , housed at the Center for Innovation , Entrepreneurship and Technology ( Cietec ) , in São Paulo .
Stents are tiny mesh cylinders , accompanied by a balloon , that are placed in the heart 's arteries or the peripheral blood vessels in other parts the body that have been partially blocked by fatty or calcium @-@ containing plaque .
On inflating the balloon , the stent expands , causing the blood to flow normally again , thus avoiding heart attacks or major surgery such as heart bypass grafts .
To put the product on the market , Innovatech signed a partnership agreement with Scitech Medical , from Goiânia ( GO ) , a specialist in the manufacture and distribution of invasive medical devices in the areas of cardiology , radiology , neurology , oncology and endoscopy .
" We make the metal platform of the stent and Scitech does the final assembly on a balloon catheter , a device that will be used to place the product in the patient 's artery , " says Spero Morato , managing partner of Innovatech , which started research with the stent in 2003 ( see Pesquisa FAPESP No. 110 ) .
The catheter comprises a transparent tube ( 145 centimeters long and 6 mm in diameter ) , with a balloon at its tip ; the metal stent is placed on this balloon .
The end product has the brand name Cronus .
By means of a procedure called angioplasty , which unblocks the artery , the device is generally introduced via an incision in the patient 's groin to the place where the lesion is and where the stent will be implanted .
A 35mm thick guide wire is used to guide the balloon .
When it reaches the lesion , the balloon is inflated , crushing the plaque that caused the blockage and expanding the stent , which sticks to the artery 's inner wall , keeping it from closing .
Then the balloon is deflated and removed from the patient 's body along with the catheter and guide wire .
This procedure is performed some 100,000 times a year in Brazil .
Until the end of 2009 , when Cronus came onto the market , all devices used were imported , because neither the technology nor a manufacturer existed in the country .
The company needed six years to research , develop and start producing on an industrial scale .
In addition to supplying the domestic market , there are plans to export the product .
" We 've already received orders from Spanish and Italian companies that distribute medical supplies to hospitals , " says the physicist , Spero Morato , managing partner of Innovatech .
Innovatech offers doctors a family of stents in six lengths ( 9 mm , 13 mm , 16 mm , 19 mm , 23 mm and 26 mm ) and three different diameters ( 2.5 mm , 3 mm and 3.5 mm ) .
Cronus stent consists of conjoined rings , with rods that are 75 microns thick .
Pharmacological stents are covered with drugs that prevent the proliferation of scar tissue on the artery wall where it is implanted , which would cause a new obstruction of the vessel .
" [ Cronus ] has the potential for causing a low amount of injury to the vessel wall and allowing the homogenous distribution of the drug .
Proof of the flexibility and navigability of this device is that it can also be used in vessels with a more complex anatomy , " wrote the experts , who practice at the Dante Pazzanese Institute of Cardiology in São Paulo .
" The pharmacological stent is in the clinical trials stage at the Heart Institute of the Clínicas hospital at the Medical School of the University of São Paulo ( InCor ) and has already been experimentally implanted in 40 patients , " says Melchiades Cunha Neto , owner of Scitech and a partner of Morato 's in Innovatech -- each has a 50 % share of the company .
" We expect , by the end of this year , to get authorization from Anvisa [ the Brazilian Health Inspection Regulatory Agency ] to start marketing it . "
In addition to carrying out the final assembly of the device and making it ready for use , Scitech , winner of the 2008 Finep Prize for National Innovation in the medium @-@ sized company category , is also responsible for the polymer coating for impregnating the Innovatech stent with anti @-@ restinosis drugs , which prevent an artery narrowing again .
The current production capacity is 600 Cronus stents a month , but the goal is to reach 15,000 units a year and thus gain a 15 % share of the Brazilian market .
This objective will be reached by expanding Innovatech 's production capacity , with the acquisition of new equipment .
To assemble the current structure , the partners invested US $ 200,000 from their own pockets to buy imported equipment , including a laser cutting machine .
They also managed to get funding for two projects from FAPESP 'S Innovative Research in Small Companies ( Pipe ) system , in the amount of R $ 610,000 , and from an Economic Subvention Project from Finep , of the Ministry of Science and Technology , in the amount of about R $ 530,000 .
As a result of the space limitations at the Innovatech facilities in Cietec -- it is housed in an area of just 50 m2 -- Morato and Cunha are planning to transfer the company to Goiânia next year .
" In this way we 'll be closer to the production line of our partner , Scitech , which should reduce production costs , " says Morato .
" We 'll leave just a research and development unit at Cietec , for testing new designs , sizes and metal alloys . "
The Cronus price is comparable with that of the imported stents in the Brazilian market .
Scitech sells the product to the SUS - Sistema Único de Saúde ( SUS ) [ Single Health System ] for R $ 2,034.00 each .
According to Morato , the price has fallen a lot over the last five years due to increased competition from stents from China , India and other countries .
Previously , the market was dominated by American products .
These stents are still more widely used but have lost the big leadership margin they used to have .
Tiny production -- The Cronus production process is careful and divided into various stages .
It all begins when the metal tube made from the chrome and cobalt alloy is cut with a laser to form the stent 's characteristic mesh .
This tube , 1.6 mm or 1.8 mm in diameter , then goes through a mechanically @-@ controlled laser beam that employs a technique known as Computerized Numeric Command ( CNC ) , which machines the metal part in a controlled manner , according to a digital mold .
This machine produces a circular and translation movement in the tube , thus giving the stent its final shape , which is similar to a spring .
When it leaves the apparatus , the piece , already with its final appearance , has its surface cleaned to remove any oxidation that may have occurred during the laser @-@ cutting process .
The surface is cleaned in an acid bath .
The stent then undergoes high vacuum thermal treatment to relieve stress and adjust the size of the alloy grain .
As a result , it acquires the right mechanical characteristics , such as flexibility and expandability .
The effectiveness of the thermal treatment is checked using an electronic microscope , which enables one to analyze the stent 's morphology and structure .
The subsequent stage consists of electrical or electrochemical polishing , to adjust the dimensions of the rods that form the stent 's mesh and leave the surface polished .
Rigorous inspection is carried out at the end of each stage , as well as at the end of the process .
With the help of a device that amplifies the size of the stent dozens of times , the Innovatech technicians assess the dimensions of each item , thus certifying that it is of the right size .
Finally , the stent is sterilized and sent to Scitech , in Goiânia , for final assembly of the catheter @-@ balloon .
It is then ready for implanting or for being covered with a layer of the anti @-@ restenosis drug .
To begin with , the Cronus development was the responsibility of LaserTools , a company set up in 1998 , which also belongs to Morato and another partner , and specializes in the laser @-@ processing of materials .
To carry the stent project forward , they created Innovatech in 2004 in a partnership with InCor .
Researchers from the institution were responsible for carrying out animal trials ( on rabbits and pigs ) and for clinical trials on humans to confirm the device 's safety and effectiveness .
First , the stents were implanted in rabbit arteries , of a similar size to a human coronary , and removed after 30 days for evaluation .
The next step was to place them in pigs , which remained with the implant for six months .
" Comparative studies carried out by the InCor team using Cronus stents and imported models showed that ours were more effective , " says Morato .
The device was also the subject of an international clinical trial , with the participation of Cimeq , the Center for Medical and Surgical Investigations of Havana , in Cuba , and InCor .
Between February 2007 and December 2008 , 53 patients were treated with 69 stents , with evidence of the successful use of the device in 98.5 % of the cases .
It concludes : " The importance of this device lies in the fact that its engineering , its pre @-@ clinical development and its clinical evaluation were conducted in Brazil , with findings similar to those of international studies , in effect a pioneering analysis in this sense . "

Resistant and flexible
Carbon nanotubes incorporated into cement and polymers result in more versatile products
Dinorah Ereno
Researchers from the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) have developed a more durable nanostructure , which contains 0.5 % of carbon nanotubes , a cylindrical structure formed by carbon atoms whose diameter is a billionth of a meter .
This small amount is enough to improve considerably the mechanical properties of the material , such as its resistance .
The process whereby these nanotubes are incorporated into the cement was developed by Professor Luiz Orlando Ladeira , from the Laboratory of Nanomaterials at the UFMG Department of Physics and resulted in an international patent that has already been granted .
" It 's a totally original incorporation process that improves the mechanical properties of the material and doesn 't make the end product more expensive , " says Professor Marcos Pimenta , from the same department and the coordinator of the National Institute of Science and Technology ( INCT ) of Carbon Nanomaterials and of a research group that focuses on developing and producing these materials ( see more on this subject in issue 118 of Pesquisa FAPESP ) .
The research is being conducted in conjunction with Cauê Cimentos , a Camargo Corrêa Group company .
Another innovative material obtained by researchers from the Department of Chemistry at UFMG , under the coordination of Professor Glaura Goulart Silva , is a flexible polymer for the manufacture of the pipes used in the oil extraction process .
In this case , a polymer traditionally employed in this type of pipe , polyurethane , had 1 % of carbon nanotubes added to it .
" The addition makes the material stronger , which allows the bending of the pipe to be controlled , " Pimenta relates .
Also in this line of innovative materials , the group added carbon nanotubes to epoxy , compounds used as adhesives to improve the tenacity and increase the transition temperature of this material .
" The addition of nanotubes enables work at higher temperatures . "
The idea is to use the composite material as a glue for coating the pipes that carry the oil in case the original material becomes worn or breaks .
The two projects are being conducted jointly with Petrobras .
In the UFMG laboratories , the researchers are managing to produce just a few grams of nanotubes a day .
However , this is about to change .
" We want to produce a few kilograms a day , which would result in around a ton a year , " says Pimenta .
To achieve this new level , they plan to set up a pilot plant for producing nanotubes on a pre @-@ industrial scale in the technology complex in Belo Horizonte ( BH @-@ Tec ) , which belongs to the city administration of the Minas Gerais state capital and to UFMG .
" We 're at an advanced stage of the negotiations to build a Nanotube Technology Center ( CTNanotubos ) , " he says .
" Our desire is to start building early in 2011 . "
The Department of Science and Technology in Minas Gerais has already made R $ 500,000 available for the initial stage of the undertaking , which includes drawing up a business plan .
One of the objectives of this plan , which is being prepared by a specialized company , is to determine the legal structure of CTNanotubos , which will be a not @-@ for @-@ profit organization .
Productive partnerships -- To make CTNanotubos feasible , the researchers plan to enter into partnerships .
The idea is that the center produces devices both for academic researchers and for companies .
" Along with the production , we are also focusing on the development of new materials , such as cement and polymers with carbon nanotubes , " says Pimenta .
For these two applications , the materials are strengthened using a device with multiple walls , in which various carbon sheets are rolled up in the shape of a tube .
For others , a nanotube with a single wall is needed , such as in applications being carried out in partnership with the UFMG Institute of Biological Sciences , in which the devices are used for gene transfection , a method in which RNA is inserted directly into a cell with no intermediary microorganisms .
The nanotube functions like a very thin needle .
One of the projects is being conducted in partnership with Embrapa , ( the Brazilian Company of Agricultural and Livestock Research ) from Juiz de Fora , for selecting cattle embryos .
A group coordinated by the researchers Clascídia Furtado and Adelina Santos from INCT Carbon Nanomaterials is also working on the development of a compound material of epoxy and nanotubes for use in different parts of aircraft , in collaboration with the Brazilian Aerospace Agency .
Another project , in partnership with Magnesita , from Minas Gerais , aims at improving the performance of refractory materials used in blast furnaces .
The research is in keeping with the worldwide trend of incorporating nanotubes into various types of products in the fields of energy , electronics , medicine and the chemical and petrochemical industries .
All studies currently under way at the UFMG laboratory will be continued in the Nanotubes Center , as well as others that involve safety issues in the production process , during use and after being discarded .
" As there are several types of nanotubes , with a single wall , multiple walls , short , long , added to other devices or dispersed in water , one must be aware of the risks involved and care required for each of these forms , " says Pimenta .
To provide scientific answers to the safety issues , the Minas Gerais research group is developing a safety protocol suitable both for people and for the environment .

The invention of Indians in Brazil
Analysis of ethnographies produced by Salesian missionaries deconstructs the notion of the anthropologist as a translator
Carlos Haag and Mariluce Moura
A highly instigating and timely debate on what is basically the role of the anthropologist -- and the nature of the anthropologist 's research work -- might be the result of the book Selvagens , civilizados , autênticos : a produção das diferenças nas monografias salesianas no Brasil ( 1920 @-@ 1970 ) [ Savages , civilized , authentic : the production of the differences in the Salesian monographs in Brazil ( 1920 @-@ 1970 ) ] , if researchers in this field accept the book 's provocative proposals -- put forth by Paula Montero - with an open mind .
The latest result of more than a decade of research supported by a grant from FAPESP -- under the theme project " Missionários cristãos na Amazônia brasileira : um estudo de mediação cultural " [ Christian missionaries in the Brazilian Amazon Region : a cultural mediation study ] and the regular project " A textualidade missionária : as etnografias salesianas no Brasil " [ Missionary textualism : Salesian ethnographies in Brazil ] , the researcher 's most recent book clearly proposes the deconstruction of the outdated notion of the anthropologist as a translator .
Instead of this encyclopedia @-@ like translation , we see the emergence of a creation -- in the true meaning of the word - as the anthropologist 's object and form of work , because " nothing had been found there previously " that was ready to be captured .
It was precisely to understand such agreements , in other words , to understand exactly what happens when these agents start interacting , that Paula decided to focus on the Salesian missions as a specific field of reflection and research .
At this point , firmly attached to the notion that ideas are driven by subjects and , as such , one must understand the related agents to understand the construction of their interaction , she observed that , if the priest 's mission is to convert , then " the native , who can be a witch doctor or the chieftain in this situation , wants to take ownership of the priest 's power to thus increase his own power in the group and become more powerful than the priest . "
" It is actually a political process ; it is also a symbol of the interaction between two heterogeneous worlds of knowledge . "
A play on words enters the stage , whereby both sides will establish an agreement on what they have to do to live together in those situations in which they are involved .
Thus , it becomes clear why the concept of cultural mediation is the key to Paula Montero 's research work and to what extent the missions became a good pretext for her to conduct in @-@ depth research on this topic .
" The ideas do not impose themselves ; the agents have to be positioned in strategic places , embellished by the skills they gained during their journeys to operate categories , build up relationships , etc . " she says .
Ideal Missionaries -- The Salesian priests ' arrival in Brazil at the end of the nineteenth century had resulted from the connection of a number of major interests , Paula points out .
In the scope of global geopolitics , it is important to keep in mind that Italy had been sidelined when Africa was being divided , and the Catholic Church desperately needed to find a new region for expansion .
In addition , the Salesian priests served the interests of a papacy that needed to ensure its recently achieved secular power , which had enabled the Vatican State to establish diplomatic alliances with the new national States in America .
" At the time , there was a non @-@ conformist view of the relationships created by industrialism .
The Salesians then focused on taking care of the poorer youngsters , viewed as having been abandoned and at risk , with the aim of integrating these youngsters into new forms of urban civility , " Paula points out .
Based on these ideals , and with the blessings of Emperor Pedro II , the Salesians arrived in Brazil in 1883 , at a time when progressive ideas were surfacing among the powerful coffee plantation owners .
It is important to emphasize that until 1910 the Salesians had had no contact with the Brazilian Indians .
Later on , the project would also successfully involve the Amazon Region and would push forward the implementation of cities until the 1960s . "
In other words , " the historical and political conditions that defined the Salesian order 's expansion project for the Americas linked to the economic and political strategies of the expansion of national sovereignty over new territories , " Paula writes .
The Salesian missions could ensure the " pacifying " of the savages , which would allow for the introduction of productive economic activities in Brazil 's hinterland .
Of course , the positivists , who had always feared the growing power of the religious orders in Brazil , disliked the Salesians ' project ; " but this project shared the mentality of that time , which preached that the universal nature of civilization as a human condition was self @-@ evident .
The proposal was to associate the principles of Catholicism with the benefits of scientism , " Paula points out .
Thus , extending the same pedagogical model of the urban experience to " savage " populations did not seem to pose any difficulties to the Salesians .
" After all , the `jungle ' , in the view of contemporary Christian imagination , was the counterpoint to the city or to Christian civilization . "
The new element , namely , the introduction of Scientifism in the relationship between men and nature , brought on a new dilemma .
In the book , the researcher points out that " by assuming that civilization , progress and country are synonyms , the Salesians , in opposition to positivism , wanted to re @-@ consecrate nature , retrieving in the savage the `natural reason ' that sees the world as God 's work ; in opposition to the `natural religion ' of the Brazilian Indians , who worship nature , the Salesians felt they had to civilize nature in order to include it in the nation 's social and rational order . "
" Pacificism prevailed in the Republic , which in practice meant that conflicts with the Brazilian Indians were not to be encouraged .
Rondon , the leading representative of the positivist `pacificist ' attitude , stood for the secular model , which would become the basis for the System for the Protection of the Brazilian Indians / SIP , created in 1910 .
" In the 1930s , the Brazilian Government had already granted the Salesians half of the subventions allocated for Catholic missionary institutions , and the format of their institutionalization , inspired by the Jesuit model , remained the same until the second Vatican Council , when the model began to lose its vigor , " says Paula .
The impact of the ideological crisis during the 1970s , which checkmated the mission model shaped by the Council of Trent , forced the Salesians to re @-@ think their relations with Brazilian policy and the Brazilian Indians .
However , the Salesians ' acquiescence to the request of the Brazilian State to participate in the " pacificist " front had not been simple .
Farming the land was the core of the missions ' autonomy and prosperity , and the ultimate objective was to train the body and the spirit of the Brazilian Indians .
Unlike a military colony or the sporadic relations of Rondon with some ethnic groups , the missionary agricultural colony , Paula points out , was a new relationship arrangement that connected units of the indigenous system to units of the colonial system in an on @-@ going relationship , to produce new relationships .
" But the two policies started off from different principles : the policy for the ethnic groups , followed by the State until the 1950s , was based on the idea of assimilation through living together with non @-@ Indians , whereas the missionary strategies were based on the idea of civilization , which preached the relative isolation of the native ethnic groups . "
Compared ethnographies -- All of this makes it increasingly clear that , by resorting to a methodology that compared three distinct moments in the relationship between the missionaries and the ethnic groups , Paula Montero seeks to explain how the interaction between the two parties changed because of the political context , of the culture of the different tribes and even because of the specific points made by each author of the narratives of these processes .
These conditions clearly produce different views of what it meant to be a native Brazilian Indian .
In this sense , the main objective of the researcher 's analysis is a group of three ethnographies written by Salesian missionaries on the Bororo and Xavante tribes from the State of Mato Grosso , and on the so @-@ called Tucano tribe , from the State of Amazonas .
The first ethnography , " Os Bororo orientais " [ The east Bororos ] , was written in 1925 by Antonio Colbacchini and César Albisetti ; the second ethnography , " A civilização indígena do Uaupés " [ The indigenous civilization of the Uaupes ] , was written in 1958 by Alcionílio Bruzzi da Silva ; the third ethnography , " Xavante , Auwe Uptabi , povo autêntico " [ Xavante , Auwe Uptabi , an authentic people ] was written in 1972 , by Bartolomeu Giaccaria and Adalberto Heide .
In the following year , he became the director of the Tachos agricultural settlements .
He believed his mission was to transform the natural savages into social beings , guided by law , order and religion .
" Unlike the Republican military attitude towards the indigenous ethnic groups , based on the idea of `pacificism ' , where the idea of civilization mainly comprised control of the territory and the population , Colbacchini assumed the existence of a `clandestine nation ' that could only become known when viewed from the point of view of the hinterlands .
This proto @-@ nation identifies itself with the principles of liberty , fraternity , and primordial innocence .
According to Paula , understanding the work of Colbacchini involves analyzing how his description mobilizes the imagination to respond to the contradictions , apparently with no solution , that the incorporation of the Brazilian Indians and their cultural differences imposes on the consciousness of man and on the awareness of his times .
Thus , in a text that still closely resembles the written language employed by the encyclopedia writers of the nineteenth century , Colbacchini creates the Bororo totemism when he goes in search of a natural religion .
The work of Father Alcionílio Bruzzi on the Tucano tribe , written under a different intellectual and political context , highlighted an emphasis on the Brazilian nature of the native tribe , shows that the missionary work conducted in the region around the Negro and Uaupés Rivers is based on the effort to integrate the native tribe into the national State .
This also implies the need to build clean and healthy constructions in cities and the building of boarding school facilities whose imposing architecture would represent the definitive civilizing work .
In the priest 's opinion , the dynamics unleashed by the missionary centers should be understood as a " civilizing " process and no longer as " catechism . "
It is important to emphasize that the arrival , in 1920 , of the Salesians in the region of the Negro River , a river basin predominantly populated by native ethnic groups , was a completely different experience from their experience in the State of Mato Grosso , where they had to mediate the on @-@ going conflicts between landowners and indigenous ethnic groups .
The " pacificism " model would not predominate in Uaupés because of a lack of settlers .
There was a fundamental difference between Bruzzi 's monograph and that of Colbacchini : " The habitus of a scientific spirit filtered by a language that wishes to be rigorous and contained is much more evident in the work of Bruzzi than in that of Colbacchini , whose language is more intuitive and passionate .
Bruzzi 's analysis is guided by science and by his desire to create an individual , even though he had been faced with the inconvenience of not having found subjects subjected to the point of living in a science @-@ based society . "
Paula points out that the focus was no longer on the savage , and authenticity became the key concept .
" Everything that refers to the native is authentic . "
Rather than focusing on conversion , the intent was to find that which was original , and culture substituted what had been previously taken up by religion .
" It was not enough for him to have elementary knowledge of the Xavante language to act efficiently in the classroom and he felt the urgent need to become more familiar with Brazilian Indian behavior and patterns of understanding .
In the 1960s , he began his more systematic work of ethnographic observation , together with Adalberto Heide . "
Giaccaria 's work describes the upcoming changes in the political and ideological scenario .
" In the 1970s , the missionary catechism program of assistance to the Brazilian Indians was beginning to lose credibility ; the boarding school system began to be harshly criticized and the idea that the Brazilian Indians should live in isolation in their own territories , namely , the reservations , produced a new consensus , " the author explains .
This is why in the sense of civilizing , so significant in the previous works , is less significant in the work of Giaccaria .
The idea of civilization gains the more secular meaning of `cultural heritage , ' and , as indicated in the title of the monograph , Giaccaria 's work centers on the reproduction of the `authenticity ' of being a Xavante .
The author 's records of myths and rites in the course of one decade is underscored by the feeling of needing to save as much information as possible on the Xavante civilization . "
What motivated the Salesians in their ethnographies ?
" To implement a project , it was necessary to convince the Brazilian Indians to live in the missions , something which the natives only accepted when driven by strategic calculations .
Each monograph , unlike the official policy for the native tribes , ( which was not interested in becoming acquainted with the object of its actions ) , implied the process of producing knowledge , the objective of which was to make the Salesians ' missionary project possible .
It is important to emphasize that this project was the result of intense and ongoing negotiation .
Above all , they had to live with the ghost of the instability of the tribal villages , constantly threatened by sudden population voids .
In addition , they had to deal with issues related to raising funds , with the production of efficient ways of persuading the urban elite of the integrity of their intentions and of the legitimacy of their work , in view of competing forces , such as the positivist attitude towards the Brazilian Indians , the pressure of the white settlers for labor and land , and the support that the Church hierarchy in Brazil and in Europe offered or not to the project of establishing self @-@ sufficient agricultural settlements .
The production of knowledge and the description of the lives of the native tribes were part of the intellectual tools available for dealing with these difficulties .
" One of the core symbolic operations of the monographs was to produce a convergence between the different ways of viewing and being in the world , introducing as the common reference the separation between the religious , social and political scopes , " says Paula .
" The grammar rules of indexation were constructed within the scope of practices , as conventions whose objective was to deal with collisions and conflicts in daily interactions . "
This translation , however , was not free from consequences .
As stated in the book , " the implicit paradox in the production of the missionary ethnography is that , in order to create an image of the native culture , the ethnographer provokes mutations in the traditional forms of memory production .
The Salesian ethnographies , as part and founding element of the conversion project , spread knowledge , for example , about what it meant to `be a Bororo ' in a way that had been unknown even to the Brazilian Indians themselves , and , in this movement , produced a kind of `conversion ' of the Bororo to the Bororo culture , " the author explains .
" Thus , the de @-@ construction of the missionaries ' discourse reveals how the mediators , no matter who they are , build themselves up as subjects of the discourse and join the dispute in the legitimacy @-@ producing process of that which they have to say . "
One can say that Paula Montero 's book focuses on the anthropology of mediations .
" Material and symbolic mediations always take place in interaction and produce discourses . "
In other words , by moving away from the idea that the work of the anthropologist is translated , and focusing on the discourse of the agents , Paula abandons the concept of otherness as the founding notion of anthropological knowledge and seeks to overcome the paradox that consists of thinking up an `other ' , prior to the reasoning itself that leads the thinking .

Brazilian diversity
2010 Census to reveal how many ethnic groups and languages exist in Brazil Carlos Haag
Carlos Haag
An ironical fact related to statistics is that nowadays we have more reliable statistics on how many Brazilian Indians inhabited Brazil in 1500 ( according to the calculations of the National Indian Foundation / Funai , they totaled 5 million people ) than how many inhabit Brazil today .
In 2000 , a study conducted by Funai stated that the indigenous population was no bigger than 450 thousand people , or 0.2 % of the Brazilian population .
However , which of these figures actually portrays the demographic dynamics of Brazil 's indigenous population ?
Nobody knows .
" The census criteria and the dates vary ; there are ethnic groups on which there is simply no information ; very little is known of the Brazilian Indians who live in the cities .
We are still totally unfamiliar with the enormous contemporary social diversity of the Brazilian Indians ; we don 't even know how many Brazilian Indians or languages exist in Brazil , " says anthropologist and demographer Marta Maria Azevedo , a researcher at the Center for Studies on Population / Nepo at the State University of Campinas / Unicamp .
" It is very clear that there is a lack of detailed population information systems to guide and evaluate public policies for the indigenous population . "
If the respondent states that he or she is a Brazilian Indian , he or she can inform the ethnic group or tribe he or she belongs to and the tribal language normally spoken at home .
In addition , the questions will be part of the sample questionnaire ( aimed at a smaller group of people and extended to a bigger population through statistical sampling ) and will be included in the full questionnaire to be answered by all Brazilians .
" This way , all the existing Brazilian Indians will be covered by the census , which was not the case in the previous Censuses .
As they are a minority , they tend to disappear in statistics when their answers are restricted to a sample , " explains anthropologist Artur Nobre Mendes , general coordinator of strategic management at Funai .
" In this way , we hope to get a better and detailed idea of the Brazilian Indian reality in the following categories : ethnic groups , geographical distribution , migration patterns , income group , educational background , health issues , etc . , " says statistician Nilza de Oliveira Martins , a researcher at the IBGE Research Department .
" The existing data only specified the `Brazilian Indian type , ' although it is widely known that Brazil has a significant Brazilian Indian social diversity .
This will be remedied in the new Census . "
As there was an excessive number of variations , the IBGE grouped the different answers under the category " pale brown , " a criterion that included the Brazilian Indians .
The 2000 Census maintained the same specifications and methodology based on the spontaneous answer of the respondent ; in other words , the question was worded in a way that made the respondent classify him or herself under the category he or she believed he or she fitted into .
In the case of the Brazilian Indians , the concept was applied to those living on Brazilian Indian lands and to those living in urban areas .
" Although an item on the Brazilian Indian population had been included in the 1991 Census , the census coverage was incomplete in terms of the information on this population ; only the Brazilian Indians living in the centers run by Funai , in the Brazilian Indian missions and in some cities were included in the census .
In addition , the inclusion of a single question ( race / skin skin color ) in the sample questionnaire , in which the respondent himself specified his skin color or ethnic origin , hampered further confirmation of the respondent as belonging to the Brazilian Indian category , " explains demographer Pery Teixeira , a professor at the Federal University of Amazonas .
" This increase was due to a higher number of people classifying themselves as Brazilian Indians when they were asked about their skin color .
These are people who had previously told the census takers that they were brown @-@ skinned and now felt more confident to say that they were Brazilian Indians .
Who were the other 58 thousand ?
These are people who know or think they have a Brazilian Indian ancestor but have no idea if they descend from the Xavante or Guarani tribes .
" We refer to these people as `Brazilian Indian descendants ' , " says Marta .
How does one explain this phenomenon ?
Brazil had -- and still has -- a more favorable environment for people to self @-@ identify themselves as Brazilian Indians .
The 1990s were a very good decade for the Brazilian Indians ; more specifically , the 1988 Constitution guaranteed the Brazilian Indians ' diversity rights ; at the Rio @-@ 92 Conference , they were linked to environmental preservation , which led the Brazilian Indians to be portrayed positively in the media .
Another factor was the research study on the DNA of Brazilians , conducted by the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) , in 1997 , which revealed that 45 million Brazilians had Brazilian Indian ancestry , " says Marta .
The 2010 Census , however , will probably show that Brazilian Indians total 1 million people , 500 thousand of whom are Brazilian Indians that belong to defined ethnic groups and languages . "
The existence of the " Brazilian Indian descendant , " however , affected the reliability of the information found in the 2000 Census .
" It raised more doubts than certainties and the new Census will help us explain these issues .
Nonetheless , it is important to understand that every self @-@ declared Census is a self @-@ portrait of reality and cannot be viewed as an instrument of accurate ethnic knowledge , " says Artur Mendes .
This new structure will allow the Census to help Funai evaluate the actions implemented in connection with the Brazilian Indians .
" If we notice that more people from a given ethnic group are living in cities rather than on the reservations , we will have to revise our programs .
If Brazilian Indians continue migrating to cities - even though they are granted reservations to live on - then something has escaped us . "
" Above all , the Census data will help the State and the Brazilian Indian organizations to improve the social control over public policies for the Brazilian Indians .
The various levels of government will have a stronger base for thinking about and evaluating policies , " Marta says .
" The policy makers always take official data into account , which in the case of the Brazilian Indians , has always been precarious historically .
And now , thanks to more accurate numbers , the Brazilian Indians will finally gain official visibility and will have more power to argue for their demands with agents of the State , " says Gersem Baniwa , general coordinator of Brazilian Indian education at Secad , the Bureau of Continued Education , Literacy and Diversity at the Ministry of Education .
In Gersem 's opinion , however , the most important data will be the identification of the existence of Brazilian Indians in urban areas , where they do not have any special protection from the federal and state governments , and in general live in extreme poverty , with no access to health care .
" I believe that the results of the Census will lead to a re @-@ evaluation of our action @-@ related assumptions and will generate a new discussion of the actions of the agents , which currently focus only on Brazilian Indian land , but that in the future might focus on urban centers , " adds Artur Mendes .
" Brazil is a multi @-@ language country and society is not aware of this fact .
We have to retrieve this singular Brazilian diversity , " says Nilza .
This is of immense wealth , in spite of the losses : it is estimated that 75 % of the Brazilian Indian languages have disappeared in the last 500 years .
" The fact that determines the future of a given language is the transmission of the language to the next generation .
Of the 150 Brazilian Indian languages , at least 21 % are seriously threatened with extinction in the short term because very few people speak them and because these languages are rarely transmitted to the new generations , " says linguist Denny Moore , from the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi museum .
" Foreigners and Brazilians themselves usually view Brazil as a country with an enviable linguistic homogeneity , which seemingly helps consolidate the nation 's political unity .
Our imagination has created an ideal formation comprised of three ethnic groups ( the Portuguese , the Africans and the Brazilian Indians ) that only express themselves in one common language : Portuguese , " says linguist Gilvan Muller de Oliveira , a professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina .
The new Census , however , will provide a chance to retrieve Brazilian Indian languages .
" A language bears the imprint of a people 's entire universe .
The entire Brazilian culture is in the vocabulary and it is very painful to lose the identity of a group , its myths , its religion , etc . , when a language becomes extinct .
This is the problem of missionary work : when the missionaries destroy the language of the Brazilian Indians , they destroy the natives ' heritage . "
" In short , because of these aspects , the 2010 Census will provide a new view of Brazilian Indians .
They are a portrait of our country , " says Marta .
" Getting better acquainted with the Brazilian Indians qualitatively and quantitatively will help reduce society 's prejudice against them , " Gersem points out .
" The numbers will show society that Brazil has many ethnic Brazilian Indian groups and languages and that this is not an invention of anthropologists .
This is not an invented discourse or diversity -- it is Brazil 's most profound reality . "

A genius of the essay
Study states that essayist Nelson Rodrigues was " Brazil 's Montaigne "
Joselia Aguiar
The ranking of Nelson Rodrigues ( 1912 @-@ 1980 ) among the foremost playwrights of the twentieth century has already been ensured by several generations of specialists .
His talent as an essayist , even though Rodrigues never had this pretension , however , is the new angle chosen by literary critic Luis Augusto Fischer , a native of the State of Rio Grande do Sul , in his book Inteligência com dor [ Intelligence with pain ] , published by Arquipélago Editorial .
The exceptional features of these texts , he explains , can elevate them to a higher category .
The description " essayist , " rather than " chronicler " provides a new status to the texts that Nelson Rodrigues published unpretentiously in the press .
" As a rule , a chronicler is a lyrical commentator on life , while an essayist writes with an active brain , even when he comments on daily life , " says the literary critic .
" The chronicler tends to be self @-@ complacent , while the essayist is strict and even cruel with himself , and he does so not because he is a masochist , but rather to achieve a deeper and more radical point of view , by fleeing from the mild cycle of the chronicle , which is happy to focus on exteriorities , " he adds .
As a result , Nelson , who had written news articles on the police and on soccer , started to write increasingly popular plays .
In the 1970s , Nelson 's son , Nelson Rodrigues Filho , went underground , fleeing the dictatorship regime , and his daughter Daniela -- " the girl without a star " -- was born with serious health problems .
The chronicles compiled in his books such as O óbvio ululante and A cabra vadia describe episodes of political and social life in Brazil , along with comments on his daily life and that of his family , on ulcers and Cardinal Hélder Câmara , and new habits and customs .
Books such as À sombra das chuteiras imortais contain sports chronicles -- so amazing that they can be dedicated to a soccer player 's spitball .
Nelson himself had no perception of the value of his chronicles .
I think one can also safely state that he didn 't even have the concept of chronicle in his mind .
However , his intuition , as well as his ability to form his language , are the main characteristics , " Fischer argues .
The idea of Nelson the essayist , a " Montaigne of Brazil , " as Fischer specifies , came from Aníbal Damasceno Ferreira , a journalist and historian who was responsible for the revival of another author , Qorpo Santo , in the 1960s .
At a lunch in 1988 , Ferreira inspired Fischer to research the theme .
Readers familiar with Nelson Rodrigues ' chronicles recognize them immediately when they come across them again .
He used such expressions as " blindingly obvious , " and created unforgettable caricature @-@ like characters , such as the protest march priest , the journalism trainee with dirty heels , or the society lady with corpse @-@ like nostrils .
As for the themes , as Fischer points out , Nelson 's most original creations are more closely related to the point of view than to the topic .
" Many other chroniclers also wrote about youth , soccer , the condition of the Brazilians , but only Nelson had unique thoughts and opinions about all of these . "
In the manner of a good essayist , he was able to flee the narrow @-@ mindedness of his times , freeing himself from such limits , to try to evaluate things from the point of view of eternity .
Nelson 's best chronicles were written between 1967 and 1970 , which witnessed the onset of the Tropicália avant @-@ garde music movement and the Soccer World Cup .
This was the time when he " reached the peak of his language , which had been undergoing the process of being polished , " the critic explains .
The leftists and young people were the constant butts of his biting criticism .
" After this , he became partially predictable , because he had already found those expressions and had confronted those enemies .
That was also a period during which he even had to engage in radical self @-@ criticism --although he had conservative leanings -- because of the brutality and censorship of those times , for example . "
Fischer 's opinion , the author of Vestido de noiva belongs to the lineage of language geniuses , which comprises " few but valorous members . "
In the Brazilian press , says Fischer , he has come across at least one other brilliant essayist , in the same sense that Nelson was ; this other essayist was Paulo Francis .
" Even after all the necessary adjustments and changes , the work of Paulo Francis -- fiction and journalistic articles -- clearly has an essayist 's heart inside , interested in analyzing things through self @-@ analysis and deep criticism , " Fischer states .
Other authors wrote and write great chronicles , although not always : Machado de Assis , Carlos Heitor Cony , Millôr Fernandes and Luis Fernando Verissimo .
In terms of foreign authors also linked to publishing works in newspapers , Fischer mentions Karl Kraus and Jorge Luis Borges as having shown " expressive originality . "
" I don 't see any direct disciples of Nelson Rodrigues , perhaps because each excellent artist really cannot be repeated .
In general , anybody who seeks to be a disciple by imitating another writer 's style becomes ridiculous , and only mimics the original -- and it 's certainly better to read the original directly than poor imitations . "
In Inteligência com dor , the literary critic also argues that Nelson Rodrigues concludes a modern constructivist project in Brazilian literature , which began with the Parnassians , involved the Modernists , and continued until the tropicalists .
The author , he argues , is disillusioned with the avant @-@ garde fantasy in the broad sense , " that kind of avant @-@ garde that drives artists to achieve the future by screaming , confronting average opinions with outwardly transgressive gestures . "
" This was seen in those groups , with variations in keeping with the times and the tastes , but this is not found in Nelson 's works , not even in his plays , I believe .
The areas in which he was commonly viewed as a transgressor had nothing to do with avant @-@ gardism , but with something deeply tragic , in the case of the plays ; in the case of his chronicles , the work was not avant @-@ garde , but had the spirit of the essay , " Fischer points out .
" Nelson is close to being a classic , and therefore he has the opposite of the avant @-@ garde temperament , which is invariably romantic . "
According to Fischer , Nelson was the first author to record the end of the Cold War , the end of the battle between a market economy and a centralized , planned economy before any other Brazilian author did so .
Few authors had perceived contradictions and even fewer authors had the courage to voice their criticism , which had become easier after the symbolic fall of the Berlin Wall .
As the literary critic explains it , it was not a question of ignoring Nelson 's reactionary attitude in the 1960s and 1970s , nor of suggesting that he had a well @-@ grounded critical interpretation based on the prophetic interpretation of the economic limitations of the former Soviet Union .
Nelson was a terrible , obtuse reactionary , sometimes laughable because of his radical conservatism , Fischer ponders .
However , he says , Nelson was right , " because he thought autonomously and adopted a broader view than the sad and mediocre polarization that had been imposed by the dictatorship , all of this because he refused to admit that those were the only possible directions . "
In his chronicles , Nelson Rodrigues came up with a theory on the Brazilian being , a notion that was so pleasing to essayists , says Fischer , that they wrote about this topic throughout the twentieth century .
The author coined phrases that in many cases became commonly used expressions .
Some examples are " Brazilians have a soul like a holiday ; the Brazilian is an upside @-@ down Narcissus that spits at his own image ; in Brazil , glory lies more in insult than in praise ; Brazilians , including atheists , are people of faith . "
Fischer says that the author was the prophet of the " blindingly obvious , " who used specific language means that were " in a latent state " in the Portuguese language . "
Thus , Nelson Rodrigues achieved his old dream of writing " in Brazilian , " as if he were chatting , something that Mário de Andrade had already attempted to do and which materialized through the work of Nelson Rodrigues .
According to the literary critic , literary language became definitively Brazilianized thanks to Nelson 's chronicles .
" Nelson made the magic , " Fischer concludes .
