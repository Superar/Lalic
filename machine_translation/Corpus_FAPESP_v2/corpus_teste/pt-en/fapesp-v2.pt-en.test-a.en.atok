Proof of resistance
Team from USP details the mechanisms by which adepts of moderate physical activity beat sedentary people in the fight against infections and tumors
Carlos Fioravanti
As in the finals of a championship , it is impossible to please both teams .
The sedentary are going to feel uncomfortable , maybe to the point of rethinking their justifications for not moving their bodies more than the minimum necessary , while those who practice regular and moderate physical activity will certainly have their pride boosted when they get to know the results reached by researcher Luis Fernando Costa Rosa .
His work , carried out at the Biomedical Sciences Institute ( ICB ) of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , reveals the mechanisms by which sportsmen are better prepared than those who are adepts of immobility to face infections caused by viruses or bacteria .
The lovers of movement also come out ahead in resistance to cancer , as is indicated by one of this group 's experiments : rats that did one hour of treadmill a day -- equivalent to two or three hours for humans -- survived for twice the time expected a Walker tumor , one of the most lethal , which leads to death in a couple of weeks .
Analyses of the blood taken both from laboratory animals and from professional sportsmen indicate that different kinds of sports , such as swimming or running , determine different responses from the immune system .
Depending on the intensity and on the muscle that are activated , there may be a greater or lesser mobilization of blood cells or of substances called cytokines , which bring about an integrated action of the immune system .
The conclusions open up the possibility of indicating the most suitable exercises for specific diseases , something until now done only on the basis of intuition , without any experimental evidence .
The team from USP concluded , for example , that swimming helps to control rheumatoid arthritis , a kind of chronic and incurable inflammation that develops in the joints , with progressive pain and deformation .
It is estimated that there are in Brazil some 2 million sufferers from rheumatoid arthritis , which is more common in women , above all those over the age of 50 .
With the caution that typical of researchers , Rosa warns , though , that the conclusions emerged from experiments with rats , and that is still early to think of immediate applications in human beings .
Supplements
But there is one part of this research whose results can already be adopted .
The team from USP examined the energy supplements based on amino acids ( the units of proteins ) sold in stores that are often in the neighborhood of fitness centers -- and the conclusion is that they do not always do all that one imagines them to do .
To the displeasure of those who dream of quickly acquiring a body like Arnold Schwarzenegger 's , the bad news is that amino acids in general do not increase muscle mass -- the supposed effect of anabolic steroids .
On the other hand , at least one of them , glutamine , really does work like an extra source of energy for cells that proliferate rapidly -- both those of the immune system and those of the wall of the intestines -- during physical exercise .
He had just got back from postgraduate studies at Eric Newsholme 's laboratory , in Oxford , England -- it was Newsholme who discovered that glutamine is the main source of energy for the cells of the immune system .
Rosa detailed this process and proved that the action of glutamine is complementary to that of the principal molecule that provides the organism with energy , glucose , even though they both follow different biochemical paths , as published in an article published in May 2002 in theNutrition magazine .
" With this metabolic adaptation " , says the researcher , " the cells acquire versatility and produce energy using an abundant raw material , glutamine , while they use the glucose to synthesize proteins that are essential to the process of duplicating cells . "
This is not the only way by which the immune system helps the organism to produce energy more quickly .
Only two years ago , Bente Pedersen , from the University of Copenhagen , in Denmark , discovered that interleukin @-@ 6 -- a protein that activates the cells of the immune system in response to inflammations -- helps to convert the reserves of glucose stored in the liver into glucose ready to be burnt by the cells .
This work established another strategic function for the immune system -- a set of 2 trillion white cells grouped under the generic name of leukocytes .
Dispersed in the bloodstream and in the tissues , the leukocytes are equivalent to 2 % of the body weight -- if they could be gathered together , they would correspond , in mass , to the liver or the brain .
They used to be regarded just as cleaners of the organism , fit only to destroy viruses , bacteria and old or diseased cells , until Pedersen 's work came to light and attract other scientists .
" There must be other proteins of the immune system that regulate the production of energy " , Rosa believes .
At the head of one of the only Brazilian research centers for exercise and immunity , the researcher from USP is getting his wind back to follow along the trail opened up by the Danish researcher , ready to assess the importance of these mechanisms in human beings .
Gains in immunity
Those who do gymnastics , who swim , run or cycle at least three times a week -- with an intensity equivalent to 60 % or 70 % of the maximum capacity for the consumption of oxygen , according to the classic definition of moderate physical activity -- have quicker access than the couch potatoes to these alternative means of energy .
But those who envy the now proven vigor of sportsmen have a consolation : ten minutes of going upstairs are enough to enjoy a now proven benefit of physical activity and to begin to muster the leukocytes .
Half an hour after starting exercise , the blood that is running through the body contains a number of white cells that is two or even four times more than normal -- the proportion depends on the intensity of the exercise , doing justice to those who do not think twice before stepping onto the treadmill or getting onto the bicycle .
But where did these leukocytes entering the circulation come from ?
They were released more intensely by the bone marrow , where they are produced , and taken from the depths of organs like the lungs , liver and spleen .
It is only two days later , on average , that these cells come out of the arteries and veins and spread through the muscles and other tissues in the body -- that they begin to cleanse the body of viruses , bacteria , toxins or even sick cells , thus fulfilling their best known mission .
This group 's work has also proved that moderate physical effort augments the response to vaccines .
In an experiment carried out at the ICB with sedentary rats , the vaccine used against tuberculosis , BCG ( standing for Bacille Calmette @-@ Guerin ) , increased by 69 % the quantity of a kind of antibody called immunoglobulin g ( IgG ) , while the trained rats gained almost double ( 135 % ) the quantity of these antibodies .
Physical activity may also recover the losses from the immune system caused by malnutrition , as is indicated by a work whose detailed conclusions should come out shortly in theClinical Nutrition magazine .
Exploring these lines of study , the two with doctor 's degrees , eight studying for a doctorate , two for their master 's degree , and eight trainees in Rosa 's team -- they all swim , run or cycle , although the coordinator of the laboratory denies that an affinity for sport is a curricular requirement -- are giving scientific support to the trite saying that physical activity does you good .
But the search for explanations for the gains in immunity calls for as much stamina as the marathon .
In March 2001 , Reury Frank Pereira Bacurau , one of Rosa 's students , concluded his doctorate showing the action of physical effort against Walker 's tumor , which attacks such vital organs as the lungs , the liver and the intestines .
Physical activity seems to act as a marker of time -- the rats in the experiment would go to the treadmill always at 8 o 'clock in the morning , five times a week .
The running may work just like melatonin , the hormone produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain .
For being released in a larger quantity at night , melatonin lowers the temperature of the body and induces sleep .
Accordingly , it acts like a regulator of the biological clock , governed by the alternation between light and dark .
The regularity with which it is released -- just as the exercised carried out at the same time -- determines the pattern for the functioning of the other processes of the organism , like digestion , heartbeats and breathing .
The growth of a tumor , in any part of the body , disrupts the production of melatonin and disorganizes the rhythm at which the organism was accustomed to function -- this is part of the organic disorder known as cachexia .
" When cachexia begins , the organism gets lost , but exercise may partly replace the nightly peak of melatonin " , Rosa says .
" The organism seems to swap the signal from the melatonin for the exercise , recovering , at least in part , the previous organization . "
During exercise , there is intense communication between the nervous , hormonal and immune systems , which are mobilized in order to generate energy as quickly as possible ( see the illustration on the previous age ) .
The experiments carried out at the ICB 's laboratory reinforced the idea that the hours on the treadmill the rats were submitted to may have reestablished the connections lost with the advance of the tumor .
Relief for arthritis
Little by little , the hypothesis is gaining strength that different exercises may help to resolve different diseases .
To reduce the pains in the joints caused by rheumatoid arthritis , for example , it is now known that swimming is an effective activity , as shown by Francisco Navarro , another of Rosa 's students , in work with female rats -- this problem is more common with the female ones .
In comparison with the animals that kept far away from the water , a decrease of up to 40 % was to be seen in the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis , by means of markers of pain , such as prostaglandin , in rats that swam one hour a day , five times a week.It is also clearer why exercise does the heart good .
At this scientific meeting in the Danish capital , Rosa will subject himself to cross @-@ examination by other specialists also with the most recent results on malnutrition and physical activity .
It has been known for at least 30 years that the lack of food reduces the production of cells in the immune system -- as , indeed , it affects the whole organism .
Besides the novelties on the processes that go on in the inside of the leukocytes , the researchers discovered a phenomenon they called the Paradox of the African Runner : undernourished rats run better than well nourished ones .
" It may be that they run faster for having half the weight of the well nourished ones , or for managing to store more energy , since they have spent 23 hours resting and one hour in activity " , says Rosa .
" In the hour they use up energy , they have more reserves than the other group . "
The team from USP reinforces the results by accompanying professional athletes , like Rodrigo Tadei and Edmundo Caetano , two stars of the Brazilian triathlon who have been taking part in the researches for five years .
It was in January last year , when he got on his bicycle , his student for a doctorate Reinaldo Bassit got onto another , and the two set pedaling off en route to Uberaba , in the state of Minas Gerais , 500 kilometers from São Paulo .
They would stop every 12 hours , after having covered 250 kilometers , and would give a little blood to a support team that followed them in a van .
" We intended to do the 1,000 kilometers there and back , but we only did 700 , because on the way back it began to rain and get very windy , near Ribeirão Preto , and we had to quit " , says the researcher @-@ sportsman , who was an rower for 18 years .
He swapped the boat for a racing bike , but he still wakes up at half past four in the morning to pedal from 80 to 120 kilometers .
He arrives at the laboratory at eight , and whenever he manages to free himself from his family duties , ends the day running the 12 to 15 kilometers back home .

Cells with a thousand faces
Brazilian teams use cell therapy to treat experimentally autoimmune diseases and lesions in the brain
In Brazil , it is not just the sufferers from heart problems who enjoy the benefits -- still at an experimental stage -- of adult stem cells , the object of intense interest , because they are capable of differentiating themselves from the cells of some tissues of the body , like those of the heart and of the brain .
After the pioneer experiments of Alberto Marmont , of the Hospital San Martino , in Génova , Italy , and of Alan Tyndall , of Basel , Switzerland , the use of this kind of stem cells is getting another application : in the treatment of the so @-@ called autoimmune diseases , when the immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs of its own organism .
Since 1996 , when Marmont and Tyndall announced the conclusions of their tests with human beings , the experiments with stem cells has spread through European , American and Brazilian centers .
At the Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine , of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , Júlio César Voltarelli concluded nine transplants of stem cells for treating autoimmune diseases , carried out in collaboration with doctors from two hospitals in São Paulo , the Albert Einstein and the Syrio @-@ Lebanese , and one from Belo Horizonte , the Socor .
According to an article to be published shortly inBone Marrow Transplantation , four patients were suffering from erythematous systemic lupus , a serious inflammation that affects the skin and the joints , and causes progressive damage to the kidneys .
Three others were suffering from multiple sclerosis , in which the defense cells destroy the myelin sheath , a covering that protects the neurons ( nerve cells ) and leads to progressive physical incapacity .
Another patient was suffering from systemic sclerosis , a disease that causes the loss of elasticity in the skin and in internal organs , and kills by respiratory insufficiency .
Besides systemic sclerosis , the ninth patient had lupus .
In work connected with the Cell Therapy Center , one of the Research , Innovation and Diffusion Centers ( Cepids ) supported by FAPESP , Voltarelli gave the patients chemotherapy based on medicines called immunosupressors , which eliminate the cells from the immune system .
At the same time , he applied doses of a hormone that stimulates the stem cells to migrate from the bone marrow -- where they are concentrated -- to the blood , which was filtered to separate the stem cells from the others .
After a higher dose of immunosupressors , the researcher put the stem cells back in the patients ' blood .
Voltarelli believes that the stem cells replace the blood cells and thus help to restore the immune system debilitated by chemotherapy .
Of the nine persons treated , three have died -- a fact that the doctors attribute to complications caused by the chemotherapy and by the seriousness already being shown by their diseases .
The other six improved , although they remain under medical care .
Five of them did not need any more medicines to inhibit the immune system , and only one was given one more dose of immunosupressors .
" Little by little , we are making headway " , says Voltarelli , who is part of the team that is preparing the first studies of two other problems for human health , rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes .
Damaged neurons
In another series of experiments , Rosalia Mendez Otero and Gabriel de Freitas , from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro ( UFRJ ) , and Maria Lucia Mendonça , from the Pro @-@ Cardiac Hospital managed to reduce -- for the time being , only in rats -- the damage arising from the death of part of the brain for lack of oxygen and nutrients .
Known as an ischemic stroke or cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) , this problem can lead to the immobility of arms and legs , and even to the loss of speech .
Deprived of blood , the neurons die and release glutamate , a chemical substance that carries out the communication between the nerve cells .
In high concentrations , though , the glutamate becomes toxic and kills the neighboring cells , extending the damage .
Rosalia noted that , when she injected stem cells into the blood of rats with cerebral ischemia , these cells make their way to the damaged area , where they install themselves and allow the neurons around the damaged area to recuperate -- seemingly by releasing chemical substances that counterbalance the action of the glutamate .
Should future research confirm this result , the use of stem cells may become an effective form of preventing , or at least lessening , the secondary effects , which only appear a few days after cerebral ischemia .
The medicines available nowadays dissolve the clot that blocks the flow of the blood , but only reduce the damage if taken in the first three hours after the ischemia .
The intention with the stem cells is to extend the period in which it is still possible to reduce the damage created by the lack of irrigation of the brain .

Mycosis from the earth
Research advance into a vaccine and target genes to fight a fungus typical of South America
After almost 20 years of work , researchers from the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) have arrived at a potential vaccine for theParacoccidioides brasiliensis which causes paracoccidioidomycosis , a mycosis typical of Latin America that affects 10 million individuals ( 80 % of them in Brazil ) .
Tests on mice and with blood samples from human beings revealed that a mixture of fragments of a protein extracted from the fungus itself generates an immune response in 75 % of the cases , very close to the level desirable for a vaccine .
In an independent but complementary manner , two groups , one from the Ribeirão Preto School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) and another made up of researchers from the center @-@ west region -- sequenced 11,000 genes of the fungus .
They found 40 genes that represent future targets for medicines , as they are ssential for the survival of the parasite in the human organism : they are linked to the aggressiveness of the fungus , with its capacity for adhering to the cells of the host organism ( for example , those in the lungs ) , or with the transformation of the mycelium , multicellular filaments that contaminate living beings , in yeast , cells that spread over the body .
This mycosis causes sores on the skin and lesions in the mouth , and can contaminate the lungs and infiltrate the bones , the joints and the central nervous system .
It is spreading , above all , among rural workers in recently occupied areas , such as the states of Rondônia , Tocantins , Pará , Mato Grosso and Acre .
The team under the coordination of Luiz Rodolpho Travassos found that small fragments of a protein ( peptides ) from the surface of the fungus , glycoprotein 43 , or gp43 , are capable of stimulating the response of the defense system of rodents againstP .
brasiliensis , a good indication of what may happen in the human organism .
While she was still studying for a doctorate under Travassos , Rosana Puccia had discovered in 1986 that gp43 activated the human immune system against the fungus -- it would work as an antigen , as they researchers say .
The entire molecule , besides stimulating the proliferation of t @-@ lymphocytes , a kind of defense cell , would set off the production of antibodies , which is not effective in the case of this mycosis .
The idea then arose of looking for a stretch of the gp43 to generate only the benefic effect : the production of t @-@ lymphocytes .
P10 , the star
Some time later , the researchers found that a small part of gp43 would also awaken the immune response -- it was a segment made up of only 15 amino acids ( the blocks that make up proteins ) known by the abbreviation P10 .
In tests with three strains of mice , P10 stimulated the proliferation of t @-@ lymphocytes against the fungus in all the animals .
After immunizing these rodents with the peptide , Carlos Taborda , who is also studying for a doctorate under Travassos , injected into the animals ' windpipe a suspension containing an aggressive form ofP .
Brasiliensis and observed that there was an effective protection against infection : the lungs suffered no damage and the fungus did not disseminate itself through the organism .
" P10 is our great star " , says Travassos .
It was still necessary to discover if P10 -- or other peptides of gp43 -- would work in man , like a key that fits a sort of chemical lock , the class II molecule MHC ( which stands for major histocompatibility complex ) .
Made up of two coupled proteins , this complex recognizes molecules that are foreign to the organism and sets off the alarm of the defense system .
In order to create the protection desired in genetically distinct populations , P10 would have to be what researchers call a promiscuous antigen -- promiscuous meaning binding itself to the largest possible number of the some 300 types of MHC class II molecules identified in the human being .
To find out if this would happen , Travassos worked with researchers from USP 's School of Medicine and a computer program that analyzed the compatibility between the structures of P10 and those of 25 of the 300 kinds of class II MHC .
It worked out : P10 fitted , with a high degree of affinity , 22 of the 25 kinds of class II MHC analyzed -- another four fragments of gp43 showed similar potential .
It may not seem much , but these 25 are the histocompatibility complexes shown by 90 % of the Caucasoid population , the largest ethnic division of the human species , which includes the peoples native to Europe , northern Africa , southwestern Asia , including India , with characteristics like the color of the skin , varying from light to olive , and hair , from straight to wavy and frizzy .
It remained to be found out how the five molecules identified would behave in contact with cells from the human defense system .
This time , it was Leo Kei Iwai , from USP , who tested the peptides in blood samples taken from 29 people who had been given treatment against infection byP .
brasiliensis and still showed an immune reaction against the fungus .
A complex picture appeared : although it was still the most effective antigen , P10 activated t @-@ lymphocytes specific to the antigen in about half of the samples examined -- a success rate that falls short of that required for the production of a vaccine with a single peptide .
The good news is that the other peptides worked when P10 failed .
According to the most recent results , the five mixed antigens show a performance of 75 % .
" This level is now ethically adequate for thinking about a vaccine " , says Travassos .
Even so , it is still necessary to overcome other stages before getting a viable vaccine for the first tests on human beings .
The first of them is to produce the peptides in a high quantity and level of purity , besides discovering which is the most efficient formulation for immunization .
Other targets
In parallel , Gustavo Goldman 's team , from USP in Ribeirão Preto , sequenced almost 5,000 genes ofP .
brasiliensis .
At the same time , the regional Center @-@ West Genome network , a consortium made up of 13 institutions from the states of Goiás , Mato Grosso , Mato Grosso do Sul and from the Federal District , mapped almost 6,000 genes , and in the February issue ofYeast published a list of the 18 most active genes of this fungus .
According to the coordinator of this group , Maria Sueli Soares Felipe , from UnB , after discounting the possible repeated genes , the team from São Paulo and the one from the Center @-@ West have mapped almost the whole of the fungus 's genome , estimated at 15,000 genes .
Goldman compared the sequences fromP .
brasiliensis with 60 genes associated with the capacity for causing disease -- or the pathogenicity -- ofCandida albicans , a fungus that causes candidiasis , a common mycosis that gives rise to whitish sores in the mouth and reddish blotches on the skin .
The results : P.
brasiliensis shows 26 genes similar to those ofC .
albicans , as is attested by an article published in February 'sEukaryotic Cell .
" These are the possible targets to be combated . "
The team from the Center @-@ West has managed to genetically alter yeasts ofP .
brasiliensis , adding a gene to its genetic material by means of a technique called electroporation , which opens pores in the cell walls of the fungus and allows the entry of foreign genetic material -- a procedure that is essential for deactivating genes .
The group arrived at the genetic transformation of five to ten funguses per microgram of DNA and is working to increase this performance , so as to facilitate the experiments .
" What we have already managed is a good start " , says Maria Sueli .
" It is a sign that it is possible to alter the fungus genetically . "

Vital protection
Pocket with calcium allows the causer of malaria to live in the inside of blood cells
For years , people have been intrigued by the capacity of the parasite that causes malaria , thePlasmodium falciparum protozoon , for living in an inhospitable environment : the inside of the red blood cells , where there is 10,000 times less calcium than what is needed for their survival .
The team led by Célia Garcia , from the Biosciences Institute of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , has revealed how this feat comes about : at the moment the parasite penetrates into the red blood cells , part of the membrane of the blood cell is folded and , like a glove that covers the hand , forms a pocket around the protozoon .
That is the secret ofPlasmodium 's survival .
The team from USP discovered that the parasite creates a calcium @-@ rich environment around it , inside the pocket that involves it , called a parasitophorous vacuole .
This is how it manages to survive inside the red cell and use the calcium in its favor , to reproduce itself .
A protein from the wall of this pocket , the Ca + + ATPase enzyme , plays an essential role in this process , by capturing calcium from the inside of the red cells .
" Little by little , we are revealing the strategies for survival that allow the parasite to do so well in the cells where it shelters " , Célia explains .
Commented on in the editorial of the same issue of theJournal of Cell Biology in which it was published , the discovery reveals possible targets for combating malaria , a disease transmitted by mosquitoes of theAnopheles genus , which in Brazil alone brings about some 600,000 new cases a year .
It is believed that it may be possible to develop medicines that block the supply of calcium and thus hinder Plasmodium 's reproduction .
In a study published inNature Cell Biology in 2000 , Célia showed another peculiarity of this protozoon 's procreation .
In the red blood cells , the parasites reproduce themselves in 24 @-@ hour cycles until exploding the red cells and tumbling by the billion into the bloodstream -- that is when a fever of up to 40º Celsius breaks out .
This is how they escape the defenses of the organism and infect other red cells .
The Plasmodium synchronizes its reproduction using one of the main hormones that regulate the biological rhythm of mammals , melatonin , released every 24 hours .
Now , for having detailed these connections , the work of the team from USP was described in the news section of Nature 's May 1st issue .

Life and death on the sand
Biologists from Rio assess the degree of destruction of 17 restingas ( coastal strips ) , where exclusive species still live
Francisco Bicudo
The expedition finished with a melancholy flavor .
In the course of five months , 20 biologists covered 1,600 kilometers of Brazilian coastline , from the south of Rio de Janeiro to the south of Bahia .
Almost inch by inch , they examined plants and animals that live in the midst of the restinga , where a low and humid vegetation grows on the sand , between the sea and the mountains .
They found 12 species of animals that inhabit this environment exclusively , likeXenohyla truncata , 3 centimeter long frog , which hides in the inside of bromeliads .
But as they carried on , in the face of swamps and continuous rain , the researchers felt that the satisfaction from the discoveries was being transformed into despondency , as they saw the gradual disappearance of this environment .
Luxury condominiums and shantytowns advanced into the coastal strips , which were also used as an illegal waste tip and a clandestine source of sand for the building industry .
Where it is still a paradise , the restingas suffered from disorderly tourism and the opening up of parking lots and trails .
The sum of the marks resulted in a first precise diagnosis of the conditions of conservation of the restingas of this piece of the Brazilian coastline .
" The restinga with the worst level of conservation is Prado , in Bahia , with 20 points " , Rocha discloses .
To be found in an equally critical situation are two restingas in the state of Rio do Janeiro , Grumari and Grussaí , both with 15 points , closely followed by Setiba , in Espírito Santo , and Massambaba , another one from Rio , each with 12 points .
" We can now see in a more concrete way the dimension of the damage " , says Luiz Paulo de Souza Pinto , a director of the Biodiversity Conservation Center of Conservation International -- Brazil , one of UERJ 's partners in the project .
Although the area of the coastal strips has shrunk 500 hectares between 1995 and 2000 in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo , according to a study by the non- governmental organization SOS Mata Atlântica , there are still stretches in a good state of conservation .
Today , the survey covers 17 coastal strips , of which seven are well preserved , three at an intermediate stage , and seven quite degraded ( see the map on page 47 ) .
" At Trancoso , in Bahia , only the stretch next to the Frade river mouth was left " , Rocha comments .
" The rest has already been destroyed . "
It is only because they are relatively isolated from towns and from tourists that some areas have still escaped from what seems to be the destiny of this group of seaside vegetation , called the gateway to the Atlantic Rain Forest .
This is precisely one of the problems .
Souza Pinto recalls that the restingas have practically disappeared before the Atlantic Rain Forest , a more exuberant vegetation to which they are attached -- and one equally devastated since the European colonizers beached their caravels .
Even today , the coastal strips are studied very little , although they sprawl over a range of some 5,000 kilometers of the Brazilian coastline , the most occupied stretch of the territory , with 87 inhabitants per square meter , five times the national average .
Formed by sand and other sediments building up on flat regions from which the sea has drawn back over the last 5,000 years , the coastal strips show different features .
On sandy soil , poor in nutrients and with high salinity , only trailing vegetation grows , made up basically of grasses -- this is the stretch most exposed to human action and the most difficult to recompose , precisely because of the soil .
As one draws away from the beaches , bushes and thickets arise , 2 to 5 meters high , with climbing plants , bromeliads and cacti .
Only further ahead , 1 or 2 kilometers from the see , do medium and large sized trees appear , which may get to 20 meters in height , like the tall fig tree , the pau d 'arco , purple glory trees and the guapuruvu .
" This change in the structure of the coastal strip was already well known " , says Monique .
" It is the studies of the vertebrate fauna in the coastal strips that were kept in the background . "
This gap has in part been cleared up by this survey .
In the course of the expedition , carried out between November 1999 and March 2000 , the team from Rio de Janeiro cataloged 147 species of animals that live in the coastal strips .
Birds predominate ( 96 species ) , followed by amphibians ( 28 species ) , small mammals ( 12 ) and reptiles ( 11 ) .
Exclusive animals
The inventory of biological diversity revealed 12 species exclusive to the region -- for this reason called endemic - , described by the UERJ team in their book A Biodiversidade nos Grandes Remanescentes Florestais do Estado do Rio de Janeiro e nas Restingas da Mata Atlântica [ Biodiversity in the Large Forestry Remains of the State of Rio de Janeiro and in the Restingas of the Atlantic Rain Forest ] , launched in June by the RiMa publishing house .
This is the case ofXenohyla truncata , a frog of up to 3 centimeters in length and weighing a little over 4 grams , which shows an uncommon behavior for amphibians : it feeds on small fruits , besides insects , as it usually happens among these animals , and thus works on the propagation of plants , by spreading their seeds in the Maracá restinga , where it was found .
Then in the coastal strips of Rio de Janeiro from Marambaia to Cabo Frio , there lives a lizard with small brown and orange stripes on its back -- this is theLiolaemus lutzae , also called sand lizard .
Abundant up to the 70s , this species is nowadays running the risk of extinction , as its habitat vanishes with human occupation .
In some areas , like Prainha , in the municipality of Rio , Barra Nova , in Saquarema , and Praia dos Anjos , in Arraial do Cabo , in the north of the state , the little reptile is no longer seen .
Up to 7 centimeters long , without the tail , it is one of the favorite preys for owls and hawks , but it sometimes manages to escape , with a peculiar trick : when persecuted , the lizard drops its tail -- the movement that it makes on the sand after becoming detached from the body attracts the attention of the predators , which is how they do not always notice the animal escaping .
Amongst the birds , the only endemic species of the coastal strip is the restinga antwren ( Formicivora littoralis ) , recorded only in one of the areas studied in the state of Rio -- and threatened by extinction , due to the accelerated degradation of its habitat .
Another species that lives in the coastal strips and also has its survival at stake is the tropical mockingbird ( Mimus gilvus ) .
In Latin , mimus means mimic -- and its capacity for reproducing songs of other birds is one of the marked characteristics of this bird , which can reach up to 25 centimeters .
With its long tail and light gray plumage on its back and white on the eyelashes , it is reminiscent of species from the thrush family , like the rufous @-@ bellied thrush .
Endemism concentrated
In the restingas , the endemic species are concentrated in two regions -- evidently , those that enjoy the best state of conservation , still little visited by tourists and the condominiums builders .
he first consists of isolated stretches along the 500 kilometers from Linhares and Guriri , in the north of Espírito Santo , to Prado and Trancoso , in the south of Bahia .
It is there that one finds , for example , theCnemidophorus nativo , a lizard with two lateral white stripes and one dorsal one of a salmon color , over an olive green body .
Described in an article in theHerpetologica scientific magazine , this species of up to 6 centimeters in length exhibits a characteristic that is rare amongst reptiles : it is made up only by females , which reproduce through a process known as parthenogenesis -- the ovum develops into an adult without the need of fertilization by a spermatozoid .
To the south , endemism is high in the coastal strips of Maricá and Jurubatiba , in Rio .
" The concentration of endemic species in these regions " , says Rocha , " is probably due to the variations that have taken place over the last 10,000 years in the level of the ocean , which caused populations to become isolated from their ancestors , and so they diverged genetically and came to constitute differentiated species . "
But , after all , will the restingas disappear ?
If it depends on the researchers from Rio , they will not .
In a book that details the discoveries of the expedition , they show what could be done , at least to reduce the human impact .
The actions regarded as a priority are : expanding the extent of the regions now protected by law and carrying out more wide @-@ ranging surveys of the species of plants and animals found in the coastal strips , besides developing environmental education programs in the coastal areas .
The researchers are also proposing the transformation of areas with the environment more degraded -- like the coastal strip of Grussaí , in the north of Rio , Praia das Neves , in the municipality of Presidente Kennedy , Espírito Santo , and Trancoso , in Bahia -- into full protection units , in which only it would only be allowed to carry out scientific research and educational and recreational activities .
" In Grussaí , there is still an important remaining area in a good state , which ought to be preserved , although it is small " , Rocha recommends .
" The environs are very degraded , because of the irregular occupation of the land . "
In the so @-@ called full protection areas , such as the National Park of the Coastal Strip of Jurubatiba , which includes the most preserved of the coastal strips studied , the predatory action of man is much reduced .
Without protection or inspection , though , human impact tends to eliminate the natural vegetation and reduce the chances for survival of the animals that live there .
Even the climate in the cities may change without the dunes and the coastal vegetation , which help to regulate the temperature .
" The pace of destruction is very rapid " , Monique laments .

The forgotten palm trees
The English find samples of palm trees that the co @-@ author of the theory of evolution sent from Pará 155 years ago
Perhaps for an extreme attachment to the British style , English naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace lived discretely -- so discretely that his legacy is still coming to light today , 90 years after his death .
Throughout four years , from 1848 to 1852 , he traveled all over the Negro and Uaupés rivers , along with another English naturalist , Henry Walter Bates .
In the following years , Wallace went into the forests of Indonesia , on the alert for rare specimens of birds , butterflies , beetles , mammals and fishes .
The dusty fragments of the palm trees are some of the few plants collected in these travels through the tropical forests .
Out of the bags came palm tree stalks ( stipes ) of almost 1 meter in length , long folded leaves , groups of flowers ( inflorescences ) , the tube @-@ shaped structures that involve the young inflorescences ( bracts ) , or just the prickly stems of the leaves ( petiole ) from species in common use , like the assai palm ( Euterpe oleracea ) or the macauba palm ( Acrocomia aculeata ) , both of which have edible fruit .
As they are incomplete , these samples " would not be suitable for describing a new species " , in the assessment of Sandra Knapp , one of the authors of an article that describes the nine items , published in thePalms magazine and also signed by Baker and Lynn Sanders , from the Natural History Museum .
" Wallace was not necessarily looking for rarities , but interested in the way that the inhabitants of the local communities used the palm trees " , Baker points out .
As the English botanists themselves recognize , Wallace sent the palm trees -- together with a letter dated August 20 , 1848 , still at the beginning of the journey -- to William Jackson Hooker , then a director of the Royal Botanic Gardens , to be exhibited as samples of the exuberance of the vegetation of the tropics .
It was also a gesture of retribution : Hooker had written a letter of introduction for Wallace and Bates in Brazil , with the purpose of opening doors for the two young researchers , with no curriculum and little money .
The unexpected legacy -- now in boxes -- replaces , at least in part , the material collected by Wallace , almost all of it lost in the shipwreck of the Helen , in which he embarked on July 12 , 1848 .
In the book Peixes do Rio Negro [ Fish of the Rio Negro ] , organized by Monica de Toledo @-@ Piza Ragazzo ( Edusp , 2002 ) , with 212 drawings done by Wallace , Sandra Knapp describes what happened on the journey back to England : " After three weeks of sailing over the Atlantic , a fire broke out on board .
Wallace went to his cabin , picked up a small metal box containing drawings of palm trees and fish , a few shirts and notebooks , before making his way to the lifeboat .
The rest of his collections -- actually , the way for him to become a member of the scientific community -- was in the hold and was lost for ever " .
Letter to Darwin
Back in England , Wallace wrote a few articles about fish and insects , besides two books , based on the drawings he had saved from the shipwreck : Travels on the Amazon and Negro rivers ( launched in Brazil in 1979 by the Itatiaia publishing house , asViagens pelos Rios Amazonas e Negro ) and Palm Trees of the Amazon , one of the rarest books on Amazonia , with only 250 copies , which he himself paid for .
In this book , the naturalist identifies 14 new species of palm trees and gave names to 12 of them .
Four of the names he proposed -- for the palm trees in the drawings on this page -- are still used , in recognition of his pioneer work .
The samples found in the Royal Botanic Gardens reinforce what the drawings and the descriptions in the book indicated : Wallace always saw the plants linked to the uses that the local populations would put them to .
This is the case of the piassava palm ( Leopoldinia piassaba ) , whose fibers were used even in those days to make brooms .
Wallace did not use to stay long in London -- he once claimed that he preferred the uncertainties of the forests to the perils of scientific debates .
But with his drawings and collections , he drew up a view of his own on the origin of the species and became the co @-@ author of the theory of evolution , almost always attributed to his fellow @-@ countryman Charles Darwin .
After publishing his bookThe Origin of the Species , Darwin found himself brought to bay by severe criticisms from other scientists .
One of the few letters of consolation that he received guaranteed that theOrigin of the Species was just as important for science as Isaac Newton 's Principia was for physics .
It was from Wallace .

Brazilian model for classifying climates designates a hundred wine producing regions in 30 countries
Marcos Pivetta
Few know the climate and the potential of so many vineyards as engineer @-@ agronomist Jorge Tonietto , from Embrapa Grapes and Wine , in Bento Gonçalves , the capital of Brazilian winemaking , in the northeast of Rio Grande do Sul .
Four years ago , when he finished his doctorate in France , this descendent of Italians who migrated to the Rio Grande do Sul hills formulated a complex system for classifying the meteorological conditions that are essential for vines to produce quality grapes for making a good wine .
And he dived into a Herculean task : after collecting a mountain of data , in partnership with the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , he compared the climate of a hundred wine producing regions , scattered over 30 countries .
He did so , of course , using his methodology , which adopts a combination of three indices to draw conclusions , whilst the majority of other systems uses a single parameter .
Suffice it to look at a graph with a summary of the results of this mega @-@ collation of equations for it to become clear that there are no two areas with exactly the same conditions of temperature and humidity .
But there are indeed vineyards with a very similar climate , which can be placed side by side in one and the same group .
The work has made it possible to separate the one hundred wine growing zones -- a little over half of them located in Europe -- into 38 climatic groups .
" Never has a study been done of the climate of the wine producing regions on a world @-@ wide scale and with more than one criterion for analysis " , says Tonietto , who was able to rely on the support of his supervisor , the Frenchman Alain Carbonneau , of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Montpellier ( Ensam ) , the second author of the system .
Some of the results of the work are surprising .
Do you know in which part of the globe are the vineyards that enjoy the climate most like the climate of Bordeaux , the region in the southeast of France that is the Mecca of wine lovers ?
Right there in France , in another three regions : Cognac , Agen and Toulouse .
According to Tonietto 's classification , the four regions have a sub @-@ humid climate , with temperate days and cooler nights .
Do you like red wines aged in oak barrels with the vanilla flavor of Rioja , the most famous wine @-@ producing region in Spain ?
In this case , the result was less noteworthy .
Characterized by being moderately dry , with the daytime temperatures oscillating between hot and temperate , and fresh nights , the climate of Rioja is almost the same as the climate of Montélimar ( Rhône Valley , France ) and of Anadia ( Bairrada , Portugal ) .
And the Brazilian vineyards ?
Bento Gonçalves came out in the same group as P 'ohang and Suwon , two zones in South Korea , a country with even less tradition in the world of Bacchus than Brazil .
The three areas are defined as humid , with days ranging from hot to temperate , and temperate nights .
The other Brazilian region studied revealed itself to be a case of its own .
With its tropical wine @-@ growing , in an area that is moderately dry and perennially hot , Petrolina , on the border between the states of Bahia and Pernambuco , in the São Francisco Valley , made up on its own a climatic group with just one member .
What do these comparisons serve for ?
The climate of the different wine growing regions , located in their majority in temperate or Mediterranean zones , is responsible , in great measure , for the diversity of the strains under cultivation and influences some of the characteristics of wine , such as the quality , the style ( whether it will , for example , be white , red , sparkling , fortified , or more or less full bodied ) and the typicality ( the set of predicates associated with the region in which it was produced ) .
" That is why we need to be perfecting all the time the forms of comprehension of the meteorological factors , if we want to carry out a proper zoning of the areas of production " , says Tonietto .
Logically , besides the atmospheric variables , other factors dictate the characteristics of a vineyard and of a wine , such as the composition of the soil in which the vines grow , the variety of grape planted and the competence and tradition of the wine grower .
But the climate is the main factor of limitation forthe expansion of the cultivation ofVitis vinifera , the ideal species of grape for making wine .
At least 7,000 years planting vines and making wine has taught man some lessons on the climate .
Generally speaking , hot areas are more propitious for producing full bodied , dense wines , with a high content of alcohol .
Potent and fortified wines in the style of Port wine are usually born in vineyards where there is no lack of sun in the period when the grape is coming to maturity .
The vocation of cold regions lies with light red wines and aromatic white wines , or with sparkling wines .
Between these two extremes , there is an infinity of intermediate climates , often difficult to be perceived or even differentiated , which may favor the production of the most varied styles of drink .
Since the first half of the last century , climatic classification models have been a useful instrument for finding more quickly the vocation , or the vocations , of the productive zones , without depending just on the empiricism of the wine growers , the old method of trial and error .
To arrive at the new methodology , baptized as Multicriterion Geoviticultural Climatic Classification System ( CCM ) , Tonietto did not need to reinvent the wheel .
His merit was to trim a few rough edges of two equations known to the world of wine growing , formulated by French researchers and normally used in isolation , the Charles Riou index of dryness and the Pierre Huglin 's heliothermic index .
He added a third index to these two formulas , for night l coldness , which he himself created .
Voilà : the Geoviticultural CCM was ready .
The first index , of dryness , draws up a balance of the quantity of water available for the vine during the stages of the plant 's growth and coming to maturity , the period that comprises the six months that precede the annual harvest .
In the vineyards of the Southern Hemisphere , this stage generally runs from October to March .
In the grape trellises to the north of the equator , it starts in April and extends until September .
The second index , the heliothermic index , quantifies the effects of the heat and of the sun on the vine in the same six months used for calculations with the previous formula .
Finally , the third equation gives an idea of the degree of coolness of the nights in the course of the last monthof the vines coming to maturity ( in general , March in the Southern Hemisphere and September in the North ) .
In figures , nocturnal cold is just the average of the minimum temperatures recorded in the month of the harvest .
As the minimum occurs after the sun has set , the index was given the name of nocturnal cold .
" Introducing this last parameter into the system has improved the assessment of the qualitative potential of the wine growing regions " , Tonietto explains .
Indeed , the occurrence of mild nights at the end of the vine 's process of maturing , in mid @-@ summer , brings the wine more color and a richness of aromas .
The system devised by Embrapa 's researcher passed the first test while still on French soil , where wine growing is an affair of State .
Before being used in the international mega @-@ project of the hundred regions , the Geoviticultural CCM was used to analyze the climate of 18 wine @-@ producing areas from the south of France , which used to grow the Syrah variety of grape , well suited to hotter regions .
The results encouraged everyone .
The methodology managed to give a precise outline of the climate of these regions and - an important detail -- succeeded in establishing relationships between the meteorological conditions of the vineyards and the basic characteristics of the wines cultivated in these parts of the land .
" CCM is currently the best methodology for characterizing the climate of a large region , like the hills of the state of Rio Grande do Sul , or of small areas , like a foothill in the environs of inn the city of Bento Gonçalves , also in Rio Grande do Sul " , was the opinion expressed , without any falsemodesty , by Alain Carbonneau , from Ensam .
" The integration of three indices has become the basis for defining zoning wine @-@ growing regions . "
This system of climatic classification is already very valuable for the development of wine growing , above all in tropical regions .
In these low latitude areas , stimulated by the heat throughout the whole year , the vine speeds up its cycle of development and goes so far as to give more than one crop every 12 months .
Petrolina , in the state of Pernambuco , for example , has five harvests in each two @-@ year period .
For the more orthodox , this crazy cycle of the vines in hot terrain is an obstacle to the formation of quality vineyards and synonymous with bad wine .
Now comes the novelty discovered by the Geoviticultural CCM : from the point of view of the vineyard , Petrolina does not show just one climate throughout the year , as the majority of wine producing regions do , but three .
And what is more interesting is that the wine growers can derive benefit from this and thereby achieve a better quality product .
At this spot in the São Francisco Valley , the first type of climate occurs from January to March , when it is hot by day and by night , but it does rain a bit .
In this period , harvesting the grapes is not recommendable , since rain at harvest time leads to diluted , watery wines .
The second climate , hot by day and by night and without any rain , is good for harvesting ; it covers the months of April , May , October , November and December .
Finally , Petrolina 's third climate is regarded as the best for wine growing .
From July to September , it is hot by day , it rains little , and -- something rare in the northeast -- there is a bit of a chill at night , which is good for setting the color and for developing aromas in the wine .
" For us to harvest always at a suitable time of year , we are going to control the growth cycle in our vineyards in Petrolina and prevent the worst crop from occurring , which is the one that coincides with summer " , explains Adriano Miolo , an enologist from one of the best Brazilian firms producing wine , Vinícola Miolo , from Rio Grande do Sul .
His idea is , in one year , to carry out two harvests ( one in July and the other in December ) and , in the following year , to have just a single harvest , in September .
" Jorge Tonietto 's work has overturned the taboo that wine growing is only viable in the more temperate climates , between the 30th and 50th parallels in the Northern Hemisphere and between the 20th and 40th in the South Hemisphere " , explains Miolo .
Petrolina , by the way , is on the 9th parallel .

Cosmic sneezes
Astrophysicists describe evolution of jets of gas 10 light @-@ years in length
Francisco Bicudo
The image that appears on the computer screen is reminiscent of the movement of a comet -- a huge bright and colored trail , which seems to rip the skies .
But this is the only similarity between these clouds of ice and dust that travel around the Sun and the supersonic astrophysical jets -- or clouds of gases violently ejected by stars in formation and by the nucleuses of distant and very bright galaxies called quasars .
The jets released by the protostars -- stars in formation -- travel at a speed close to 400 kilometers a second , equivalent to dozens of times the speed of sound in the interstellar medium , and they can reach a length of as much as ten light @-@ years ( one light @-@ year corresponds to 9.5 trillion kilometers ) .
Then there are the extragalactic jets , which move at speeds close to the speed of light ( 300,000 kilometers a second ) and extend for millions of light @-@ years , which is equivalent to dozens of the times the diameter of our galaxy , the Milky Way .
" As we unveil their enigmas , we succeed in understanding better how stars are formed . "
And , do not forget , it is the fusion of chemical elements in the insides of stars that spawns the raw material of every living being .
Accordingly , investigating the jets and the stars means looking for our remotest origins .
Coordinated by Elisabete and by Jorge Horvath , the group from USP has been achieving pioneer results in the study of high @-@ energy astrophysical phenomena , which include the mechanism of the explosions of supernovas , neutron stars , and bursts of gamma rays .
Last year , the São Paulo researchers surprised the Europeans and Americans who work in the same area by concluding the first hydrodynamic simulation on a computer of the HH @-@ 34 , a giant protostellar jet that has been much studied , located to the south of the Orion nebula , some 1,600 light @-@ years from the Earth .
The universe recreated on the computer has revealed that the HH @-@ 34 is one of that kind of immense jets , measuring about 10 light years from end to end .
An even larger giant
This confirmed the results achieved a few years previously by another research group .
Between 1994 and 1997 , astronomers John Bally , David Devine , Bo Reipurth and Steve Heathcote , of the United States , observed a chain of small knots of gas , bright and aligned with the HH @-@ 34 jet , in those days still regarded as small .
It used to be believed that these nodules were independent , but physicists showed that they were actually ejected by the same protostar , forming what appeared to be a gigantic jet .
" Our numerical simulations reproduced quite accurately the observations and left no doubt that we are in fact dealing with single structure , one mega @-@ jet " , notes Elisabete , one of the authors of the article with the detailed results , published in July 2002 in theAstrophysical Journal .
This gigantic jet , with its sinuous shape , had already caused an about @-@ face in the studies on the formation of stars .
In accordance with what was known , the jets from protostars seemed to be less than one tenth of the size of the HH @-@ 34 , even when it appeared on its own and isolated from the nodules which are today regarded as part of its body .
Supported by FAPESP , this work represents a thorough look at astrophysical jets , starting with the HH @-@ 34 .
It is now known that there are nodules in its structure that researchers attribute to the fact that the star , when being formed , releases gas in an intermittent , non @-@ continuous manner .
The study details the evolution of the jet from the initial moments of its formation until being expelled and interacting with the gas of the interstellar medium , during its 10,000 years of life .
With the benefit of this detailing , the HH @-@ 34 has become a scientific landmark for the behavior of astrophysical jets .
The group from USP is concentrating on the study of the jets from protostars for one basic reason : this kind of jet is quite common in regions close to formations of stars , inside our own galaxy .
They are therefore more easily observable than the second group of jets , the extragalactic ones , expelled by quasars -- nucleuses of distant galaxies with black holes with some 100 million times the mass of the Sun .
In spite of the differences in origins , size and velocity , the extragalactic jets show very similar shapes and behavior as those of the protostar jets " , the researcher says .
" The information obtained in the study of the protostar jets helps us a lot to understand the phenomena that occur in those that are produced in remote extragalactic regions . "
Their life history is not all that distinct .
In the case of the protostars , the cloud of primordial gases -- such as hydrogen , helium and oxygen -- condenses under the action of gravity and makes a central core , which will give rise to the star , surrounded by a gas disc , which spins with an increasingly faster rotation .
When the rotation meets a speed limit , to the point of preventing the condensation from continuing , the star violently expels clouds of gas from its axis of rotation .
This is how the jet is formed , and , at the same time , reduces the speed of rotation both of the cloud and of the star .
As a consequence , the condensation of the protostar continues , resulting in a mature star like the Sun .
But the course of the jet that left the star is not always a tranquil one .
If it collides with other clouds of gas , the jet forms supersonic impact waves , known as bowshocks , interacts with the interstellar medium , and deposits in that region part of the material that is brought from the star -- a spectacle of brightness and colors .
At this moment , the jets act like bees that are carrying star seeds and pollen to regions far away from the spot where they were generated .
According to the researcher , the jet can induce the birth of a star , when it collides with a cloud with sufficient mass to implode -- or , in technical language , to go into gravitational collapse .
Larger jets may even destroy the giant cloud that houses them .
" It is possible for that to happen , but there has been no direct observational evidence " , the researcher says with caution .
It was Elisabete herself , in 1993 , when she was doing postdoctoral studies at Harvard University , in the United States , who developed one of the techniques used in computer simulation of astrophysical jets , in partnership with the Swiss physicist Willy Benz , in those days a visiting researcher at Harvard .
Until then , the calculations were based on the numerical integration of the hydrodynamic equations for the jet , with the computational domain -- a virtual space that simulates real space -- divided into a network of fixed points .
This new technique , called SPH ( Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics ) , replaced the network by particles that move with the fluid .
This change made the simulations quicker and more feasible on more modest computers , like the ones the researcher had to go back to using after returning to Brazil , that same year .
The recreation of the universe
Virtual reality is managing to reproduce what is happening in the universe with increasing accuracy .
On the computer , the gas in the interstellar medium is represented by a box in the shape of a cobblestone , filled with gas .
At the base , there is a hole , through which the jet from the protostar is injected .
Inside it , the jet is accelerated supersonically , forms the nodules of gas that move at a supersonic speed , and interacts with the gas in the interstellar medium .
Obtained in conjunction with the National Autonomous University of Mexico ; Elena Masciadri , from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy , in Heidelberg , Germany ; and Adriano Cerqueira , State University of Santa Cruz , in Bahia , the results are next compared with the astronomical observations , above all those obtained from the European ESO telescope , located in La Silla , in Chile , and by the Hubble space telescope , the group 's two usual sources of information .
As knowledge about astrophysical jets becomes consolidated , the team is diving into the disc of gas that forms the jets , in search of particulars of the phenomena that go on in the regions closest to the star in formation .
The results that the researchers are arriving at emerge at a moment that new information on the universe itself is bubbling over .
The astrophysicists are working intensely on the wealth of raw material captured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) , the American satellite that in February , in its first batch of results , gave the universe an age of 13.7 billion years , a sure fate -- expanding for ever -- and limits estimated today at 15 billion light @-@ years .
" After hundreds of years in which the observations with telescopes only managed to go as far as the back yard of our galaxy , we are seeing further and further " , the researcher points out .
" Astronomy has come out of its adolescence and reached maturity . "

New virtual music and science institute researches experimental ways of composing and playing
Marcos Pivetta
At times , they are misunderstood both by the folks from the arts and by the people of the sciences .
They seem rather beyond the fringe , in sense that their activity is found , in certain cases , beyond the more hallowed lines of study at the universities .
Some of them are musicians who like , and make use of , scientific concepts and technological devices to play and to compose , and are frequently viewed with reservations by their peers , with their more classical profile .
Others are scientists who use their knowledge in areas like physics , mathematics and biology to interact with composers and instrumentalists , and are quite often looked on as oddities by their academic colleagues .
However , when these two extremes draw closer without prejudice and the bonds that unite music and science become stronger , marvelous creations can emerge .
Hybrid products , half art , half technology , like the computer program called MAX / MSP , a sort of work environment and operating system , used all over the world by musicians who are researching into new forms of composing and presenting their works .
MAX / MSP was created by theInstitut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique , better known by its acronym Ircam , a powerhouse of ideas located in the Georges Pompidou Centre , in Paris , which for 34 years has been stimulating different lines of research in which the common thread is marriage of music and science , under the baton of French composer Pierre Boulez .
It was a bit with this vanguard spirit at Ircam that a group of researchers from São Paulo universities -- the one from the first paragraph beyond the fringe , in the best sense -- decided to create , with support and finance from FAPESP , a similar institute , but virtual , without any physical premises , to coordinate multidisciplinary projects in the areas of music , science and technology .
Some of these projects already exist , others will come with time .
" Our idea is to join together in a larger program the ventures that are scattered today over several music departments and institutes of science and technology " , says researcher Silvio Ferraz , from the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and from the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo ( PUC @-@ SP ) , the main power behind the virtual institute .
" This is going to give weight , prestige and a common bearing to these lines of research , though , logically , the individuality of each one of them will be respected " , is the comment of José Fernando Perez , FAPESP 's scientific director .
To start with , four major lines of work will be stimulated : the study of the acoustics of concert halls ; the analysis of works with the help of a computer ; the promotion of compositions and performances that use , in real time , a PC or other equipment as if they were musical instruments ; and the use of computational intelligence in the study of musical creativity and cognition .
As the virtual institute takes shape , other themes may be incorporated into the score .
The first activity to be promoted by the institute , which will shortly boast a website to integrate its members and their respective projects , will be the Ircam @-@ Brazil event , between August 8 and 14 , in São Paulo .
In the course of seven days , ten researchers from the French center will be giving talks and concertos and will take part in scientific meetings with their Brazilian colleagues .
With the exception of the talk on the 8th , which will be Unicamp 's Arts Institute , during the 9th Brazilian Symposium of Musical Computing , the others will be held at the Itaú Cultural Institute , in the in the city of São Paulo , which has lent its installations for the event .
Always at night , the musical presentations will be at the Theater of the Alliance Française and the Teatro Cultura Artística , on dates yet to be confirmed .
Although they were conceived specially for researchers in the area , the workshop 's activities will also be open to the public in general , after signing up beforehand at the Itaú Cultural Institute .
" We want to increase the interchange with international institutions that are benchmarks in research into music and science " , Ferraz comments .
Events along the lines of Ircam @-@ Brazil , which also enjoys the support of the French consulate in São Paulo and the Franco @-@ Brazilian Center for Technical and Scientific Documentation ( Cendotec ) , should be repeated in the coming years , bringing to Brazil , for example , researchers from the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies , and from the Groupe de Musique Experimentale de Marseille ( National Center of Musical Creation -Gmem ) .
Brazil does not have much tradition in fostering researches that join art and science together , two distinct but not incompatible forms of knowledge , of feeling and of interpreting the world .
But this does not mean that the virtual music and technology institute is starting from scratch in its mission for tightening the bonds between these two fields .
It is starting precisely from projects that already exist and are proving to be instigating .
And what already exists , just in São Paulo , is a little umbrella of ideas capable of giving shelter to the crossbreeding of musical research and creation with such different areas as sciences of computing , physics , biology and mathematics , not to mention flirting with other disciplines from the terrain of the arts , like dance and the theater .
An example helps one to understand the kind of work done by the nucleus , made up of some 30 persons , counting both teachers and pupils , both from music and from other areas ( mathematics , computing sciences and engineering ) .
In the first image used to illustrate this article , you can pick out a dancer with dark clothes , lit by a spot light , and entangled with red patterns that seem to come out of her body , in a beautiful visual effect created by the photographer , using a set of lights fastened to the performer 's attire .
There is also , in the background , a keyboard .
Believe or not , this dancer , Andréia Yonashiro , is " playing " the instrument with her movements , with each passage described by her choreography .
No , it isn 't an optical illusion , science fiction , or an apparition .
The answer to this false mystery lies in the dark surface touched by Andréia 's feet , which hardly appears in the photo : a special one square meter mat , which is connected to the synthesizer .
The mat is fitted with 12 piezoelectric sensors , which record small variations of the electric potential , when pressed in the movements of the dancer .
With the assistance of an analog @-@ digital converter , these electrical alternations , measured in microvolts , are transformed into events for the Midi ( Music Instrument Digital Interface ) protocol , a sort of musical language that makes use of a table of numbers to represent the level of the musical notes ( do , re , mi , fa , sol , la , ti ... ) and their intensity .
Besides the floor that makes music , the Nics team created gloves and ballet slippers that also work like audio interfaces .
Albeit of an experimental nature , all these devices have already been used in artistic performances conceived by the researchers and presented at events in Brazil and abroad .
Digital luthier
Nics has also developed a series of computational tools that can be used to produce simple or complex events in sound -- provided that the user is skillful and learns to use them correctly .
Rabisco ( Scribble ) , for example , is a program that generates music from lines drawn in free style on a blank screen .
" We are a sort of digital luthier " , explains Adolfo Maia Jr . , a professor from the Applied Mathematics Department at Unicamp and an associate coordinator at Nics .
A curious paradox between the past and the future , since the luthier 's craft is the delicate and ancient art of making , by hand , string instruments with a sound box , like violins , cellos and guitars .
This São Paulo composer is devoting himself to exploring the possibilities of so @-@ called electroacoustic music , an experimental branch created at the end of the 40s in Europe ( in France and in Germany ) , whose main historical landmark is Germany 's Karlheinz Stockhausen .
Please do not mistake the passion and the subject of work of Menezes , who has been playing the piano since he was 5 years old , with electronic music , that drum and bass sounds that rock interminable parties of a good part of today 's youth parties .
The artist who embraces electroacoustic music , sometimes called concrete or acousmatic music , composes works that are an elaborate assembly of sounds modified by the modern resources of computing .
The major part of the sounds is prerecorded and originates from musical instruments or from any other source of audio , like a door that is slammed , or a horn that is sounded .
The more mischievous would say that electroacoustic music is more electroacoustics than music , but this estrangement is due to the vanguard nature of the movement .
" Many of my colleagues , including musicians , see me as the mad scientist of music " , comments Menezes , jokingly .
One of the most marked traits of the electroacoustic works is the extreme concern with the form of spatial diffusion of the music when facing an audience in a theater or concert hall .
A good stereo sound , with the traditional two audio outputs , is not enough .
Musicians like the researcher from Unesp , who studied in Germany , Italy , Switzerland and France ( Ircam ) , want , at the least , quadraphony , the possibility for spreading their music from a stage fitted with four independent audio outputs .
The ideal is even more than that .
For them , the movement of the sound through the loud speakers , the path of their collages of sound through the acoustic equipment , is an indissoluble part of their works .
So much so that Menezes is anxiously awaiting the arrival of his " loud speaker orchestra " , to construct his " theater of sounds " , this latter term taken on loan from the Italian Renaissance .
A project financed by Fapesp , called Puts ( PANaroma / Unesp : Theater of Sounds ) will be an " orchestra " made up , to start with , by 12 loudspeakers of the very highest quality and four subwoofers , a kind of amplifier dedicated to reproducing low @-@ pitched sounds .
" With this equipment , which can be carried to the place of the presentation , we will be able to do electroacoustic concertos of an excellent audio quality " , Menezes explains .
Acoustic simulation
Talking of audio quality , the study of concert hall acoustics , one of the foundations of the nascent virtual music and science institute , has now , since last year , been the target for a thematic project .
Coordinated by Fernando Iazzetta , from the music department of the Communications and Arts School of the University of São Paulo ( ECA / USP ) , the venture has as its final objective the development of a software , using Brazilian technology , to carry out analyses of the dispersion of sounds in small auditoriums , places with up to 100 seats in the audience .
In principle , the idea is to develop an application for modest sized places and , at a second point of time , to adapt it for use in more ample environments .
" Today , there are imported products that do this , but they can cost up to US $ 40,000 " , says Iazzetta , who can count on the collaboration of researchers from the areas of mathematics , architecture and civil engineering in the project .
" Our goal is to create an open architecture program , which can becopied by anybody . "
How does this kind of application work ?
The software runs on a laptop equipped with special microphones that capture sounds , at previously determined frequencies , which were emitted in the environment whose acoustics one wishes to study .
Next , the program compares the frequency registered in the concert hall with that of the original sound and thus to provide a ruling on the place .
This is a schematic explanation .
Obviously , the procedure is not as simple as all that .
Actually , the software will not be limited to registering and giving a verdict on the properties of the propagation of sound in concert halls .
In a virtual environment , it will also work like a simulator of the acoustics of any place that one wishes to study , provided that is supplied with the dimensions and other physical characteristics of the place .
" This will enable us to make `virtual ' alterations in the layout of this concert hall and to foresee what the implications will be for its acoustics " , Iazzetta explains .
" The software can be a useful instrument for proposing corrections to the places where the presentations are made . "
Vampires of sound
Before starting the thematic project on acoustics , Iazzetta participated in the Young Researcher program with his colleague Silvio Ferraz , who was behind the virtual music and science institute .
At that time , they both tried to understand how technology interferes with the process of creation and to explore new ways of composing and playing .
At the beginning of their careers as musicians , Iazzetta studied percussion , and Ferraz , the horn .
But today they both frequently define themselves as laptop players .
This is because computers nowadays accompany them at almost all their performances , in which they use a lot of material prerecorded and processed by the PCs .
" Today , I have a lot of interest in developing software that composes on their own , in programs that perforate sound " , explains Ferraz , who last year went so far as to play as a musician of a more classical style in orchestras from the states of São Paulo , Bahia and Paraná .
" We are vampires of sounds , to use an expression from my colleague Rogério Moraes Costa ( of ECA / USP ) . "
Besides an adept musician in performances rocked by the sound of computers , Ferraz , who will be in charge of a major part of the work of making the virtual institute 's team to run , together and in tune , the projects of this interdisciplinary venture , is also developing a side of a more conceptual , more theoretical researcher .
Availing himself of teachings from areas like semiotics ( the study of signs ) and cognition , he likes to discuss what music is for people .
" A lot of folks associate the idea of music with the existence of a beat and a melody " , he says .
" But there are indigenous chants without these elements .
When reading a poem , why do some people find it musical , and others not ?
What transforms a soup of sounds into music ? "
These and many other queries and quests will be the staff and the score that the institute 's activity will be conducted to .

Iberê Camargo revisited
Almost ten years after the painter 's death , research produces a catalog of theartist 's works
Renata Saraiva
A scientific assignment is helping the Iberê Camargo Foundation , from Porto Alegre , to produce a definitive document about the works and documents that there are on its premises by the painter from Rio Grande do Sul .
Eight researchers have been working for three years on classifying and cataloging over 3,000 drawings , 217 oil paintings and 354 etchings that there are in the institution .
The study has support from Petrobras , from Itaú Cultural , from the Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio Grande do Sul - which is financing two scholarships for scientific initiation -- , from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) and from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul ( UFRGS ) .The work will result in the issue , in 2005 , of the catalogueraisonné of Iberê .
The publication , which will be divided into three volumes ( for paintings , engraving engravings and drawings ) will be launched together with the inauguration of the Iberê Camargo Museum , a daring work of over 8,000 square meters , built on the banks of the Guaíba River , to a project by Álvaro Siza .
The design won an award at the last Venice Architecture Biennial . " The
catalog will contribute towards protecting Iberê 's works against forgery " , says Mônica Zielinsky , the coordinator of the works for theraisonné .
" We are aware that the works at the foundation are just a part of the artist 's legacy , which must be around 7,000 works .
At the moment , a retrospective show is taking place of the painter 's works , entitledIberê Camargo : In the Face of Painting .
There are a hundred or so works , among paintings , drawings and engravings , chosen and organized by art critic and curator Paulo Venâncio Filho .
They are currently being exhibited at the State of São Paulo Art Gallery ( until July 20 ) , and follow in next to Rio de Janeiro ( Imperial Palace ) Recife ( MAMA ) and Salvador ( MAM ) .
In the exhibition , also to be seen are sketches and models that give a good notion of how the building designed by Siza will look .
By a coincidence , the catalog , the museum and the retrospective are happening close to the year in which would complete his 90th year .
Born in 1914 , the painter died of cancer in 1994 .
" The work of cataloging proved to be far more extensive that we imagined at the first instant " , tells Mônica Zielinsky .
" There are difficulties , because besides being work originally prepared by hand , using cards , everything afterwards is recorded on a database " , she says .
" Wehave to identify works of which we have little detail .
So we depend a lot on the memory of people who have been close to Maria , his wife , and Eduardo Haesbaert , who was his printer ( of etchings ) and is today responsible for the collection . "
Although these two living sources have much information on the work of Iberê , the level of detail for cataloging , classifying and identifying is extremely great , which calls for an enormous effort in research .
Besides the name attributed to the work and the technique employed , each cards includes the date of production , the place signed , a transcription of what Iberê may have written on the back , the value estimated by the painter himself , a parable ( in the works for which the artist created a code ) and an inscription ( for example , when he dedicated the work to a friend ) .
" We also took note of the conditions in which the work is to be found at the moment of being cataloged , so that it will be possible to monitor what will happen with it in the course of time and when it is lent for an exhibition " , Mônica observes .
" We discovered things that were unknown to the public and to some critics , like figurines and scenarios for the theater .
Also found were paintings on ceramics , tapestries , and even a work done on the bark of a banana tree . "
This is not to mention a few curiosities , like the bills from the shoe repairers and a lot of documents and letters .
The cataloging done by the team will not only make it possible to identify Iberê 's works -- avoiding forgeries -- but also contribute towards the work of art researchers and even biographers .
While this is not yet possible , the public in general can get a good idea of the main phases of the painter 's career in theIberê Camargo : In the Face of Painting exhibition .
Divided between rooms , the works follow a chronology , but not in a linear way .
To make this clear , Paulo Venâncio Filho opted to put at the beginning of the exhibition space works from the beginning and from the end of the painter 's career .
Separated only by half a wall , figurative works from the 40s , like the landscape of Rio calledLapa and aSelf @-@ Portrait are in the same environment asSolidão ( Solitude ) , the last canvas painted by Iberê in the year of his death .
In the other rooms , one can see Iberê Camargo 's pictorial evolution .
Although not linked to a specific artistic movement , he marked the history of Brazilian art with a very personal gestural expressionism , in which the explosion of the paints and the brushstrokes on the canvas portray a very intense personal uneasiness .
" His hallmark is pictorial research , which never abandoned .
Iberê , born in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul , always had an awareness of the importance of painting in Western culture .
Going to live in Rio de Janeiro and studying in Europe , he always set before him the challenge of being a great painter .
He did not belong to a movement , but neither was he an alienated painter , particularly with regard to artistic matters .
He fought , for example , to perfect the techniques of painting " , says Venâncio .
In the pictorial journey presented by the exhibition , two elements can be found that are just as present in the works of Iberê Camargo as thelittle flags in Alfredo Volpi 's : reels and cyclists .
" They are symbols for his reminiscences of childhood , very important for Iberê " , Venâncio comments .
Uneasy
The shadow of these oils on canvas -- present , for example , in the countless pictures that have reels as their theme -- has called the attention of the media .
But what one notices is that it does not necessarily refer to Iberê 's relationship with the end or the unknown .
" Analyzing his work as a whole , we notice that throughout the whole of his life he was a very uneasy man .
His painting reflects this " , says Mônica .
To give an even greater quality to the work of cataloging Iberê 's work , the team coordinated by Mônica is also carrying out works of reflection , with the purpose of producing texts and conferences about the artist 's contribution towards the history of Brazilian art and culture .
These researches are based on the methodology of Michael Baxandall , a scholar from the area of the social history of art , which uses analytical theory as a method of work .
" The work consists of inter @-@ relating documents and works so as to arrive at a conclusion on the repercussion of Iberê 's work on the artistic and historical panorama of the country " , the researcher explains .
For Mônica , the three volumes resulting from the research are just the first of a job of cataloging that may be continued whenever new works of the artist are discovered .

Playing on the fringe
The philosopher thinks that Brazil should avoid bumping into the currentcomplex of monopolizing technoscience
Luiz Henrique Lopes dos Santos , Mariluce Moura and Neldson Marcolin
Provocative and polemical , Professor José Arthur Giannotti , 73 years old , can be seen in many different ways .
As he himself observes , there are those who regard him as a traitor to Marxist thinking .
Or rather , to the positions and practices of the Brazilian left , although he was removed by the military dictatorship from office at the University of São Paulo ( USP ) in 1969 , precisely for his critical views and left wing practice .
For his part , Giannotti , in whose language one can easily descry the influence of the fundamental analyses of capitalism by Marx , in parallel with the dialog that he is always establishing with various other thinkers , like Wittgenstein , to interpret the contemporary crisis of reason , prefers to define himself as " the last of the Marxists " - thereby letting escape a smattering of the amusing irony that so frequently punctuates his words .
Whatever one thinks of Professor Giannotti , whether one agrees or not with his analyses , one must consider that his theoretical contributions in the field of philosophy , his public interventions in his capacity as an engaged intellectual about politics in Brazil , and his concrete work as a professor and researcher , makes him one of the most important personages in the attempts to draw up a consistent critical thinking to provide support for the country to transcend its poverty and its underdevelopment .
And he has been like this since the 60s , wherever he was : at the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo ( PUC @-@ SP ) , at the Brazilian Center for Analysis and Planning ( Cebrap ) , which , together with former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso , he founded and ran for 11 years , or at USP , and where he went back to after the general amnesty of 1979 and where he is today an emeritus professor .
To fulfil the task that he set himself to think about the problem of rationality in the contemporary world , Professor Giannotti has , for some time , been sharpening the instruments for exploring one of its central aspects , which is the field of science and technology .
How so ?
But at that time , we were covering almost only projects supported by FAPESP , which was not the case .
-- That would have been good .
There has been an almost absolute silence about that work .
I think it is because , even while it maintained the dialectical Marxist positions , the essay was a dismantling of closed Marxism .
And afterwards , I get the impression that these are political things ; to the extent that I had gone towards the center together with Fernando Henrique Cardoso or something like that , for a long time I was regarded as a traitor .
Until the moment that Lula also came close to the same position , and now I am together with him in the same concentration camp .
In the book , you said , in other words , of course , that if the process of capitalist development depends essentially on technological development , then the concept of value @-@ work is put into question , and doubt is cast on the idea of capitalism being exhausted and overcome , as Marx conceived them in the third volume of The Capital .
-- He was already saying this in the first volume .
Look , the notion of value @-@ work finds a measure in the time socially necessary for the production of goods .
But this time is a clock time and therefore depends , for it to be a good measure , on the productivity of work .
Well , for you to arrive at this measure , you need to have processes by which all the areas that work in the system can avail themselves , at least in theory , of the same technology or of a same mix of technologies .
But when you have a situation in which one part of the system appropriates not only technology , but also the capacity for developing it , you have changed the system .
That is to say , the capitalist system -- and this is trite , because it has been known ever since Adam Smith and Ricardo -- depends essentially on technological development .
The exploratory process is linked to the invention and construction of new products .
If you have a process that upsets the market , if in this process of technological development , you create strategic points that are power points in the field of science , then the value @-@ work theory has gone up in smoke , hasn 't it ?
What is left over is the sociology of the relationship between workers and capital , which in my view is still very strong .
It is a very special relationship of power , in which one has control over the work of others , anonymously , done by the rules of the market .
But from the economic point of view , the value @-@ work theory , in my view , is a museum piece .
In " Feiticeiros do Saber " , we felt there certain echoes of the first chapter of he German Ideology , by Marx and Engels , albeit as irony .
Because right away in the subtitle of the article you say that " the researchers in the vanguard , nowadays , ( ... ) are researchers in the morning ; and they run a little molecular biology company in the afternoon " , which calls to mind the claim that communist society " makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow , to hunt in the morning , to fish in the afternoon , to raise cattle in the evening , and to be a critic after supper " Was playing with this idea what you wanted ?
-- Yes , I 'm not a fellow who talks seriously , I never say things without there being some other thing behind it .
It 's a bit of fun with regard to Marx , obviously , but I am also showing , on the one hand , the enormous advantages that there are in this joining together of intellectual work with the actual work of technological and social transformation , and , on the other hand , the loss that this brings to some .
After all , I am not going to be a businessman , I think that Luiz Henrique [ a professor in philosophy who takes part in the conversation as an interviewer ] is not going to be a businessman , and we are really a species facing extinction .
These isolated researchers , who live in their cabins in Morumbi and so forth , are disappearing .
Counterbalancing this , these joining together of the researcher and the businessman can be good , socially speaking .
-- No , I 'm not denying that .
I 'm not acting like a mandarin , contrary to mass culture .
I have nothing to do with the Frankfurt School .
On the contrary .
I think that the mass society has defects , absolutely terrible alienations , but it has unheard @-@ of virtues .
Unheard @-@ of !
Both in culture and in , for example , healthcare .
We aren 't going to forget that people are living longer , they have more assistance , even in the poorer countries , they suffer less .
I am not an enthusiast of capitalism , I would like it to be different , but I prefer capitalism to the brutality of agrarian societies .
When you join together the words sorcerer and wisdom , what is the intention ?
-- Another bit of fun .
A lot is said about fetish in merchandise , right ?
I wouldn 't say " the fetishism of wisdom " , because it would be very ......
Pedantic ...
-- Not just pedantic .
It is worth recalling that fetish , in Portuguese is a corruption of sorcery ( fetiche andfeitiço ) , then let 's speak the normal language .
It so happens that , starting with the classical tradition , the wise have been opposed to sorcery , science is what is opposed to myth , the scientist is someone opposed to the shaman .
But science can also become a fetish .
And this is one of the most terrible things of the mass society : the fact that the good secondary schools are disappearing , good basic education , with people learning by having their ears pulled , using concepts without having any notion of the techniques for applying these concepts .
That is , wisdom is learnt in the same way that merchandise is consumed .
-- Even worse , it is more like something toxic , because consuming merchandise , at least you digest , you feed your body .
Everybody is capable of talking about space @-@ time when they go to watch Kubrick 's film , and obviously this is a kind of make @-@ believe .
If on the one hand I go to a bookshop and I have a pile of good books to read and good CDs to listen to , on the other , I have a fascinating quantity of rubbish , an Augean stable .
Everything is very ambiguous , and there is no reason for us to keep pointing a finger and saying ; " Look ! , this capitalist world is this and that " !
It really is bad , but it has brought positive things as well .
What we are talking about is alienation .
Wouldn 't a critical work of overcoming this alienation be fitting ?
What do you think of this , politically ?
-- We can pick up again certain Marxist theses , but we cannot pick up Hegelian dialectic again , that it , a dialectic of overcoming contradictions , provided that one really understands what a contradiction is and understands that a unification of contradictories can only take place at the level of discourse .
This is a basic sentence of Hegel 's -- that contradiction is resolved at the level of discourse .
Hegel could say : well , it is resolved in the spirit of the world , because the world is discourse .
As we no longer believe in this , we have to think about putting up with contradiction , as another of our bandy @-@ legged dialecticians says , which is Wittgenstein .
Well , putting up with contradiction is to try to explore these more , shall we say , creative , more vital , more movable and hence more distressing part of daily life , and leave aside that part that is more dead and more repetitive .
-- The example that I mean to talk about is already in Comte himself .
On the one hand , we have one of the best analyses of how scientific method works , to end in what ?
In the invention of a new science , sociology , with the task of regenerating the whole of scientific knowledge .
The moment Comtism comes with this idea of regeneration , with the idea of a scientific policy , and prostrates itself in front of the images of Clotilde de Veau , there , obviously , the same movement that led to the deepening of scientific knowledge , ends in an alienation , in a religion , in the fetish of science .
In other words , I would say the following : it is very difficult to separate the two processes .
I get the impression that the alienation of science is routine .
In the first article , you deal with a certain monopolization , of the enormous economic and political advantage achieved by one who besides knowing how to develop technologies has a powerful machine at its disposal to make as short as possible the path from scientific discovery to the product .
That means the United States .
-- Not only them , there are also some important corporations , and not just from the United States .
I am not denying that , in a series of small nucleuses , they are inventing things and getting patents , that would be silly .
But when we consider the overall workings of the system , it is the large corporation that counts .
In this process , what place is actually left for a country on the periphery of capitalism ?
-- Well , I need a link here .
These large corporations , as we know , are basically transnational , but that does not mean that they become independent of the State , or that the State is completely massacred by them .
On the contrary , the dialectics of the State and of the large corporations have changed .
The recent Gulf War is a precise example in this sense .
Iraq is not occupied in the traditional way , but there they are , defining how the oil is going to be exploited or otherwise , and in a short while we will have scientific development from that point onwards .
It is inevitable : new ways of producing oil , of exploring for minerals , etc .
These corporations have 20 @-@ year plans .
So we have a very particular division of work between the State and the corporation : it loses sovereignty , but it can gain effectiveness and control daily life in a way that was inconceivable 30 years ago .
Suffice it to remember the deterioration in human rights in the United States .
And this is done by the State .
It is the State that is massacring human rights .
The idea of putting folks in cages in Guantánamo is somethingreminiscent of totalitarianism .
But , to insist , what room is left over for a peripheral country ?
-- Playing on the fringe .
I can 't see any other possibility .
The idea that we have some possibility of facing up to this complex is preposterous , so we can only play on the fringe .
But there we have to avoid a very great danger .
The other day , at a conference , I heard a colleague who presented the general system of the development of modern capitalism , and it was such a closed circle , that we had no way , we would go to hell .
At the following conference , by Barros de Castro , from Rio , he said : " We have a way out .
There are goods , like Embraer 's aircraft , on which we can get certain prizes , besides added value , because of certain market advantages ... "
In other words , what he was saying is something new : instead of proposing an industrial policy , systematic or systemic , as Cepal , the Economic Commission for Latin America , would have it , we are going towards a product policy .
In accordance with our inventiveness , we may earn more or less -- and this is our point .
In fact , I despair when I see these people who keep on saying : " I can 't do anything " , as if the world were a Laplacian system .
There are things to be done , and if we don 't do them , the consequences will be very serious .
We saw the demolition of Argentina , and we are seeing the dreadful thing that Africa is .
Moreover , we also know that not everyone is tarred with the same brush , as we used to think .
Bush or Clinton , for us , makes an enormous difference .
If we do the right things , will we not be able to abandon the fringe ?
Can you not see that possibility ?
-- For us to be a great country ?
This will probably be in the long term , and then we will all be dead , as Keynes would say .
But there is a great problem in this situation .
Today , for example , everyone talks about China .
The question is how to turn a great country into a democracy .
Some people say : " Oh , we are creating a consumer society , in which everyone is going after the latest model of blender , that is something monstrous ! "
Except that how are you going to prevent this inside a democracy ?
People want to consume .
I am not saying that people ought to have consumer schools .
But can 't we start a more creative process of diversification in education ?
What do you call diversification in education ?
-- Here in São Paulo , in the last few years , a good part of the élite has come out of some very particular colleges .
Can we not expand the experiences of these colleges to get a good public secondary schooling , with better teachers and better equipment ?
This is possible , provided that the public school incorporates something that today is being much denigrated , which is the merit system .
It has to be remembered that one thing is political democracy , another thing are institutions based on merit , where there is a career , there are selections , etc .
Didn 't the experience of the experimental schools linked to the public universities work out a little like that ?
Were they not a space for pedagogical experiments that could be passed on to the public network ?
-- Yes , and , today , I am in favor of recreating and multiplying these university colleges to carry out policies of affirmative action with regard to Negroes and to the poor , creating conditions for them to compete in this world .
In the second article in Mais , the feeling that remains is that you have at last resolved , inyour criticism of Marxism , to deals with the folks from the Frankfurt School .
-- Who are not Marxists ...
Well , in first place , what was the movement of the Frankfurtians ?
To say that the moment for the revolution has passed and that capitalism now has nothing more to do with the economic laws , that the economic laws have been so subverted that you can 't take out of them a criticism of economic relations in capitalism .
But when I say that the question today is the monopoly of technology , I am introducing an economic notion , which is the notion of the monopoly .
The difference , then , is crucial .
In second place , the Frankfurtians said : " Fine , if it 's not through a criticism of economics , we are going to do a criticism of culture , OK " ?
And this criticism of culture was done on the basis of a theory of concept , in the case of Adorno and Horkheimer , or of a theory of linguistic systems , in the case of Habermas .
Except that Adorno 's theory of concept , in my view , is very weak !
For example : the notion of clarification , which is the translation for Erklärung , I understand it when one refers to the illuminist movement , because there it is descriptive .
But when you say that Erklärung is illumination and illustration , unalienated reason , I think that this is no more than to redefine in an arbitrary way reason in its dynamic aspect .
And afterwards , you just have to get examples to say " That is a movement of reason " or " this isn 't a movement of reason " , " this one here is creating a dialectic of anti @-@ reason " .
Very convenient , isn 't it ?
In the article , you also touched on the question of the separation between objective reason and subjective reason .
-- Because in the criticism of all these folks it becomes fundamental to separate a technical reason from another one , a substantive reason .
I 'm sorry , I 've never seen a technical reason !
I even know about technical reason at work , on the basis of , well , I have this objective , and then I do a rational analysis of the means .
Do you see in some scientific work this process , in which you have a hypothesis and afterwards go on to rationalize the means ?
I 've never seen one , because this is pure make @-@ believe .
And it really is a very serious problem , because these folks always think of the concept as if it didn 't need an opaque otherness to be able to work -- a set of objects and practices implied in the technique for applying the concept .
You raise one more problem when you say that one has to recognize that there is a crisis , the roots of which are to be found that contemporary sciences are produced , coupled with the new forms of capitalist sociability .
-- I am even going back to a more Marxist position , saying : look , the question is not one of duality of reason , the question is the way by which capitalism is appropriating this absolutely extraordinary complex , created by capitalism itself , of science and technology .
The problem then is how are we going to make this complex democratic .
How to make science go back to being done to the benefit of humanity , which is not happening today .
Suffice it , for example , to remember that research into tropical diseases is much less developed than research into diseases that affect the rich countries .
And is there anything to be done in the ambit of the researchers themselves , of the agencies , of this whole system for producing science and technology ?
-- I think that it is obvious there is .
Look , when we have centralization and sclerosis , there is only one remedy , which is the liberal one : multiplying the points of power .
Universities today are more and more monolithic , so that we have to do away with their stony nature .
Universities today are very funny , they want to form an autonomous system , when the foundations have made holes in them on all sides .
And , on the other hand , we also have the development agencies , which are today not only places for financing research , but for inducing research .
After all , the Genome Program was no joke .
Not only was research induced , but a network of laboratories was created , a new rhythm for producing science and technology in Brazil was created .
This can be done .
Autonomous in relation to what ?
If it is dependent on the political system like this one is , then it is better for it to be autonomous , because otherwise we wouldn 't have any currency .
But it would be very good if we had a democratic control over the Central Bank , in which there were a way of obliging it to render accounts to a series of institutions .
Well , just look at how contemporary political ideological works : either you gather everything together in the State , and it becomes entirely a controller , or you simply want a sort of liberalism that isolates the institutions without their being irrigated by other system .
I am entirely in favor of a controlled autonomy of the Central Bank .
Translating this into science , what ought we to have ?
-- We ought to have a system in which the universities have an outside control .
A control by society , represented by trade unions , trade associations , students .. I don 't see any problem there at all .
Furthermore , a system in which the university foundations are transparent .
To judge from your recent articles , you have been poring over questions of knowledge , technoscience and art .
How are all these parts brought together ?
-- At bottom , all these themes I am working with are aspects of the same problem , which is rationality .
I am thinking how it is that you judge things .
What is esthetic , moral or scientific judgment .
And I am much more interested in dealing with the question of the crisis of reason , which is showing how , despite reason working , it has a need for gray areas , of indefinition .
This , by the way , is the advantage of scientific knowledge , or of the arts , or morals , and not the contrary .
Morals that are absolutely determinant are not taking into account contemporary moral experience , in which one lives with different moral systems , with people who believe in and follow different standards .
And when it was decided that we have an eternal conflict , that isn 't true , because in the case of medical ethics , for example , things are resolved in a very interesting manner : people with different ethics and without establishing a defined consensus , they give way here and there , and the thing is resolved .
That is , the moment you institutionalize difference , you can carry on having rationalizing institutions , without it being necessary to appeal to a monolithic reason , and illuminist reason .
I am wanting to show that it is possible for reason to live in peace with its shadow .
Moreover , I am wanting to show that reason needs these shadows to be able to develop .

Virtuous circle
Taxes paid by innovative companies exceed amount of public investments
Tânia Marques
There are no statistics available and , by the very nature of scientific research , the injection of funds in one or other area does not always produce results in the short term .
But , in the case of some projects strongly associated with the market , carried out in partnership between universities and companies , it is possible to risk an estimate .
Between 2001 and the middle of 2002 , the tax payment of at least eight of the 30 companies connected with the Center for Research into Optics and Photonics ( CePOF ) , one of the ten Research , Innovation and Diffusion Centers ( Cepids ) sponsored by FAPESP , added up to R $ 10.5 million .
This result was more than double the Foundation 's investments of R $ 4.5 million over two years , according to a calculation by Vanderlei Bagnato , the coordinator of the Center for Optics and Photonics in São Carlos .
These innovative companies are also meeting another target desired by any developing country 's government : they supply the market with products that are similar to and cheaper than the imported ones , and when the quality opens the door to the foreign market , they add value to the exported national product .
The example from CePOF makes it plain that the fulcrum for this whole process is partnership .
The center gathers together 140 researchers from the physics institutes of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , in São Carlos , and of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) , the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute ( Ipen ) , Unicamp 's School of Medical Sciences , USP 's School of Medicine in Ribeirão Preto , and the Amaral Carvalho Hospital in Jaú .
This is the city where a cancer treatment center using laser light has been set up .
The CePOF -- which , like the other Cepids , has among its objective knowledge transfer to the private sector -- keeps up its links with 60 companies from the Campinas and São Carlos , which express themselves in the shared development of products and the supply of research services , and even in making their laboratories available .
The joint efforts of universities and private enterprise generate much more than taxes : they produced 20 patents , from the beginning of 2001 to October 2002 -- and five of these have been licensed and the resulting products are now being marketed .
" This relationship is a two @-@ way street , in which both the risks and the gains are split between the parties " , Bagnato comments .
" And we are still learning to work at the pace of the companies , which need agility in their launches , to prevent a competitor from taking the lead " , he adds .
He goes even further : he estimates that the companies connected with the CePOF , in São Carlos , are also making a contribution towards reducing , by US $ 1 million a year , Brazil 's costs with the imports of products in the areas of optics and photonics .
One example of this is Opto Eletrônica .
The company developed an instrument with the diode laser technology , for treating tumors and macular degeneration linked to old age , one of the most common causes of blindness in the aged .
Its market price is US $ 10,000 .
Its imported equivalent goes for US $ 30,000 .
The company is now reaching an agreement for marketing it in Europe .
The equipment was developed in conjunction with the CePOF , and with the support of researchers from USP 's School of Medicine and of the São Paulo School of Medicine , of the Federal University of São Paulo ( Unifesp ) .
Opto Eletrônica had the support of FAPESP 's Small Business Innovation Research Program ( PIPE ) .
The funds totaled R $ 117.3 million and US $ 115,800 .
The company currently has revenues of R $ 50 million and 460 employees .
It originated at the High Technology Park Foundation ( ParqTec ) in 1985 , and , in the last few years , expanded its business until it formed a conglomerate made up of Opto Sul , in Rio Grande do Sul ; Opto USA , in the United States ; Opto LA , in Mexico ; and Artech , headquartered in São Carlos , which is the leader in the Brazilian market for treating lenses to get the anti @-@ reflective effect in glasses .
In Campinas , the partnership with the CePOF was strategic for consolidating the market for companies like Komlux , which produces Blanket Lux , a mantle woven of optical fibers for treating physiological jaundice , which , every year , affects 5 % of the newly @-@ born babies in Brazil .
The mantle , which was the cover story of issue n ° 44 of thePesquisa FAPESP magazine , published in July 1999 , is awaiting certification by the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency , and will be put onto the market for about R $ 2,900 , against the US $ 3,500 of the imported equivalent .
" Latin American and European companies , and from others from the Middle East and Eastern Europe , have already shown interest in Blanket Lux " , says Cícero Lívio Omnega Filho , Komlux 's director @-@ president .
The development of the mantle was supported by FAPESP , also in the ambit of PIPE , with total funds of R $ 169,200 and US $ 125,200 , and gave rise to two patents .
The capacity for innovation of the companies connected with the center has been a fundamental factor for expanding their competitiveness at home and abroad .
" Both in optics and in photonics , there are various sufficiently original themes for scientific research , with a great market potential " , says Hugo Fragnito , from Unicamp 's Gleb Wataghin Physics Institute , and the coordinator of the CePOF , in Campinas .
One of the biggest customers of Opto , of São Carlos , in the line of reflectors for dentistry , is Gnatus , of Ribeirão Preto , a manufacturer of equipment for dentistry , the third in the world market , with exports to the four continents .
With 27 years in activity , the company , which sold R $ 70 million in 2002 -- some R $ 30 million in sales abroad -- , started to draw closer to research institutes in the mid @-@ 90s , with a view to certifying its products , so as to adapt them to international requirements .
At the time , the value of the Brazilian currency was almost equal to the US dollar , and efficiency was asine qua non condition for keeping one 's position in the market .
Today , Gnatus has all the internationally recognized certificates and reaches extremely high levels of productivity , with its 460 employees .
" Partnerships have been intensifying and tend to grow " , explains Gilberto Nomelini , the company 's director superintendent .
" The Optlight LD photopolymerizer , which was a byproduct of research , is recognized as the best apparatus in its category , and is now being exported to various countries " , says Nomelini .
MM Optics was created in 1998 by a group of engineers , with the objective of producing the first Brazilian microscopes for educational purposes , competing with the Chinese ones .
" We launched an end product that is more robust and precise , at a final price 35 % lower than the imported one " , recalls Fernando Mendonça Ribeiro , one of the founders of the company , which last year commemorated the R $ 1 million mark in sales .
In 1999 , the company turned to the development of lasers for medical and odontological purposes , at the request of USP 's Physics Institute in São Carlos , which was trying to meet the demand from USP 's School of Odontology in São Paulo .
Baptized as the Twin Laser , the product is now in its second version , and it costs R $ 3,600 , against R $ 15,000 for the equivalent imported product .
It can also be used in dermatology and acupuncture , amongst other applications .
In 2001 , together with the CePOF , the Syrio @-@ Lebanese Hospital of São Paulo and USP 's Faculty of Odontology , MM Optics developed the Mucolaser , a low potency laser for the treatment of mucositis , an infection that affects patients with cancer and undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The equipment costs R $ 7,000 .
And , in 2003 , the company launched their Bright LEC , which uses fibers developed in partnership with the CePOF and Gnatus , and combines in just one apparatus techniques for polymerization and whitening of the teeth .
It costs R $ 3,800 , a little more than one quarter of the amount for the similar imported ones .
The product 's quality and competitiveness have won over the foreign market : 7 % of the sales of MM Optics came from sales abroad.In
Campinas , companies linked to the CePOF also have their eyes on the foreign market .
Padtec , the only company in the Southern Hemisphere to produce a communication system with WDM technology , which expands the transmission capacity of the optical fiber networks , intends to reach US $ 3 million in export sales this year .
" Besides Latin America , we are beginning to do business with India " , says Jorge Salomão Pereira , the director of technology .
The company separated itself from the CPqD Foundation -- a research arm of the Telebrás system -- , its main stockholders , in mid @-@ 2001 .
Six months afterwards , Banco Pactual bought 22.5 % of its stock .
It is currently the market leader of the segment in the Brazilian market , supplying the main telecommunication companies in the country ; sales of US $ 5 million were recorded in 2002 , of which 10 % went to the coffers of the state and 12 % to the federal coffers .
And it has even multiplied its workforce from ten to 60 employees in two years .
" Our average salary is US $ 900 " , Pereira reveals .
" We have never lost anyone because of salary " , guarantees José Ripper , the president of Asga .
The company , which has 30 employees , also originated in the CPqD and is nowadays a partner of CePOF .
Asga was the first company in the country to develop an optic multiplexer -- equipment for telecommunications operating companies that transforms luminous electrical signals in optical fiber networks .
Asga gets R $ 299,800 and US $ 153,000 from PIPE .
It now has branches in Argentina and in Mexico , besides representatives in Asia , and it grossed US $ 30 million in 2002 .
This year , to compensate for the downturn of investments in the sector , the company 's strategy is to expand its foreign business .
" We have always done basic science , and we will continue to do so , but without losing from sight the commitment to produce wealth for the country " , Bagnato concludes .

Partnership and good business
Universities and companies invest in innovation to boost exports
Santa Gertrudes , a municipality in São Paulo with a little over 16,000 inhabitants , is the largest center for producing ceramic floors in the Americas .
There are 40 companies there , producing 200 million square meters a year of ceramic tiles , 40 % of Brazil 's production .
Exports still represent 10 % of sales , but they are growing every year , shipped mainly to the markets of America , Mercosur , Latin America and Europe .
But the product from Santa Gertrudes still has a low added value : the price abroad varies from US $ 2 to US $ 3 the square meter , one third of the market value of similar Italian and Spanish products .
To consolidate foreign business and improve the quality and competitiveness of the product , the Brazilian Ceramic Center ( CCB ) , laboratories connected with the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , the Federal University of São Carlos ( UFSCar ) and the São Paulo State University ( Unesp ) and a group of 20 local companies have formed , with support from FAPESP , the Sectorial Consortium of the Ceramic Tile Industry in the State of São Paulo .
Another consortium with a similar format , bringing together a private university and three pharmaceutical laboratories , has now been formalized .
The objective is to investigate and to validate new phytomedicines using plants from Brazilian biodiversity .
New materials
In the case of tiles , research is being carried out at the laboratories of the Center for Technological Innovation in Ceramics , inaugurated last year .
In one of the lines of investigation , for example , the researchers are studying the use of new materials for porcellanato , a ceramic regarded as top of the line , as it absorbs less water , between 0 % and 0.5 % , it has less porosity and greater resistance .
The results of this research are strategic : the level of water absorption in the products from the industry in Santa Gertrudes lies between 6 % and 10 % .
" We are already on the way to 3 % , which is the average for Europe " , says Paschoal .
The researchers are also developing high performance enamels that resist wear , for applications in floors with heavy traffic -- as , for example , in supermarkets -- and bactericide enamels for hospital use .
" We are thereby targeting new market niches " , Paschoal explains .
For a period of three years , FAPESPwill support the consortium , with funds for implementing and modernizing laboratories and by means of scholarships applied for individually by the researchers taking part .
The partner companies contribute with R $ 50,000 a year , at the least , for the maintenance of the consortium , depending on their size and form of participation .
Paschoal explains that some companies are at a stage he classifies as " pre @-@ competitive " , as he says ; that is , in order to perfect the products , they need knowledge of general interest that does not interfere with the market strategies of the sector as a whole .
Other companies have , as he says , " a more competitive focus " , with a demand for specific information for innovating in the product and consolidating the market .
For these companies , the Center is carrying out , for example , design projects , always protected by non @-@ disclosure agreements .
Innovation will also bring other advantages : it will increase the earnings of the ceramics center and the number of jobs in the region .
" We want to be a success story " , Paschoal concludes .
The biotechnology nucleus of the University of Ribeirão Preto ( Unaerp ) entered into a consortium with three laboratories for pharmaceutical products , in order to develop , with support from FAPESP , new phytomedicines with Brazilian plant .
" They are not competing products , since they have distinct therapeutic actions " , the director observes .
" Our participation is to validate effectiveness and safety in the use of phytomedicinals , in accordance with the legislation of the Brazilian Sanitary Surveillance Agency ( Anvisa ) , with special attention to the control over the chemical quality , configuring each asset of the plant .
Once this is done , the companies implement the process of production " , she explains .
The association through the partners is done through a technological and scientific cooperation agreement , which provides for the benefits being split , in the case of patents being lodged or of royalties .
Suzelei is betting on the success of the enterprise .
" The Brazilian market for phytomedicines is growing at a rate of from 15 % to 20 % a year and is now registered sales of US $ 1 billion " , she says , comparing this with world @-@ wide sales of US $ 15 billion .
" But we are also going to develop products for animal use " , Suzelei discloses .
The expectation is that the validation of the products will be concluded in two or three years , when the phytomedicinals will beready for clinical tests .

Social paradox
Project aims to legalize building lots in areas of water sources , without jeopardizing the quality of the water
Teresa Navarro
The houses spring up in a disorderly way , on irregular lots where cesspools are mistaken for wells .
Some houses do not even have a cesspool : the sewage runs along the streets , cutting channels until it reaches the lowest region and hits one of the various springs of the basin of the Billings reservoir , which supplies water for about 1.5 million persons from the municipalities of Diadema , São Bernardo do Campo and Santo André .
This is the scenario at Sítio Joaninha , ( Little Joan Site ) in Diadema , where 240 families live .
The environmental degradation of the area is identical to several other irregular lots of land , which occupy between 15 % and 20 % of the areas around the water sources of the Billings and the Guarapiranga lakes , to the south of the metropolitan region of São Paulo .
According to the legislation , in order to guarantee the preservation of the water sources and the quality of the water , these building lots should never have existed .
So much so , that the city halls are forbidden to provide them basic infrastructure -- like running water , electricity and sewers -- under penalty of being included as defendants in lawsuits in the civil courts and of being convicted to put right the damage .
And this is the challenge for the project Reparation of Damage and Adjustment of Conduct in Urbanist Matters , proposed by the Public Prosecutor 's Office , which is being carried out by the College of Architecture and Urbanism ( FAU ) , of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , and which is part of FAPESP 's Public Policies Program .
" The question must be seen from the social , and not merely environmental , point of view .
The occupations happened because the demand for housing has always been greater than the government 's capacity for offering low @-@ cost houses " , is the explanation of the coordinator of the project , Maria Lucia Refinetti Martins , from FAU .
Legal knot
The occupation of the water sources results , on a daily basis , in an avalanche of lawsuits in the Public Attorney 's Office of Justice for Housing and Urbanism in the capital .
They are public civil lawsuits filed following denouncements by neighbors , at the request of city halls , or of the inhabitants themselves , wanting to regularize their situation .
For the law to be strictly observed , the attorney 's office would have to ask the courts to expel the lawbreakers .
And for a long time this was exactly what public attorney José Carlos de Freitas did .
" Wewould sue the person who sold the lots , the municipality and the state , and we would ask for the dwellers to be removed , as the law requires .
Protection for water sources in the state of São Paulo is ruled basically by three laws : one federal law and two state laws .
Generally speaking , they restrict the occupation of the ground in regions close to basins that supply water to the population and adopt criteria for density of occupation ; they divide the area by categories that range from being totally improper for occupation ( those closest to the basin ) to those where occupation is permitted in plots of at least 500 square meters .
" The objective of the legislation is to guarantee the quality of the water " , Freitas explains .
" It is within this spirit of the law that we are going to work to regularize the building lots , provided that there is a commitment from all those involved to repair the damage caused to the environment ; this made is possible by means of signing a term of adjustment of conduct " , he explains .
It was to get input for the terms of these agreements that the Public Prosecutor 's Office got in touch with FAU .
" Our goal is to define what has to be done on the lots to guarantee compliance with the spirit of the law and to untie this knot between the environmental and social issues " , adds Maria Lucia .
Sítio Joaninha
From this perspective , the first measure was to carry out an investigation of the lawsuits existing in the public prosecutor 's offices in Diadema and Santo André , and to select for a case study four sets of plots located in the Guarapiranga and Billings sub @-@ basins : Sítio Joaninha ( Diadema ) , Parque Andreense ( Santo André ) , Jardim São Francisco ( Embu ) and Parque dos Químicos ( São Bernardo do Campo ) .
Sítio Joaninha was chosen for being one of the most problematic areas of building lots .
It occupies an area of over 200,000 square meters , and is located by the side of a sanitary landfill , out of use today , but which until the 80s received all the garbage of São Paulo .
Worse , the plots of land bought by the inhabitants did not belong to the person who sold them , which makes it difficult to grant ownership for usucaption .
" They aren 't even asking for sewers " , explains Sonia Sumiko Karazawa Nagai , head architect of the Integrated Planning Division of the Diadema city hall .
The mayor 's office is negotiating with the Public Prosecutor 's Office the conditions for regularizing the building lots , since the intention is to reduce removal to the fewest families possible .
" First , we need to define precisely the area that can be occupied " , Sonia explains .
Supported by FAPESP , the project has already identified some alternative techniques that may guarantee the quality of the water , without needing to remove the families .
The first step is the treatment of the sewage , which can be done on the spot , in the lowest area of the plots of land , close to the basin of the stream .
Maria Lucia believes that this is an " interesting solution " , because it also prevents housing from being installed very close to the stream , since the space would be occupied by the treatment station .
" The ideais to create a protective belt " , he explains .
The city hall is studying yet another possibility , which is to pump sewage up to the São Caetano Treatment Station .
Work has now started in the Eldorado region , nearby Sítio Joaninha , and it could be extended to the building lots .
But this has not yet been decided " , explains Sonia Nagai .
The need for works of infrastructure also includes setting aside an area for planting trees , drainage , and improving the state of the streets , without this meaning paving them all .
Maria Lucia explains that stretches of earth have to be left , and sidewalks with grass , to absorb the rainwater .
The poor conditions of the streets in the region do not constitute a more serious problem , but they do isolate the inhabitants .
The Mail , for example , does not get into thelots : the letters are left at a florist 's in the lowest part of the region .
The concern of the Diadema city hall and of the Public Prosecutor 's Office in giving possession of the areas to those dwelling there has an explanation : in the majority of times , the occupation of the areas of the sources of water is involuntary .
" I found out that it was an area of water sources when I went to ask for electricity to be connected to my house , and they told me they could not connect it .
I had no idea that this was what it was " , explains Raimunda do Vale Ferreira , vice @-@ president of the Association for Housing and Environmental Preservation of Vila Joaninha .
Electricity , which in Raimunda 's case came after a long pilgrimage , is today a privilege for half a dozen families .
The others make use of clandestine connections that form veritable spider 's webs over the houses .
Action by inspectors
Improving these people 's living conditions has its risks : the lots -- sought after today for their low price -- are going to become more attractive when there is water and electricity .
The city hall has now drawn up a register of the families and is starting a survey of the existing buildings on the land , to prevent further construction .
But in spite of constant visits by the inspectors , other works are under way .
Fausto Veronese , an inspector from the city hall , explains that when the building is a new one , the city hall notifies the owner and orders work to come to a halt , but many carry on .
" In these cases , we begin a lawsuit asking for the demolition of the building " , says Veronese .
According to him , some of these lawsuits are now at the final stage of the process , but there is not yet any case ready for demolition .
" The city hall will have to intensify inspection , and the inhabitants must undertake to denounce a neighbor who starts a new work .
Then there is the Public Prosecutor 's Office , which can sue the city hall and the state , in the case of omission , and take measures to go after the lawbreakers ' assets " .
But nothing of this is going to work if the decisions of the courts take too long , he points out .
Until all this changes , the " For Sale " signs spread all over Sítio Joaninha .

The art of negotiating
City halls and states may shortly be able to count on the assistance of new techniques for negotiating conflicts in areas of occupied water sources .
The proposals are being developed in the Negowat project , financed by the European Commission and the French Agricultural Research Center for International Development ( Cirad ) , and also supported by FAPESP , in the modality known as Grants for the Coming of Visiting Researchers.Originally developed in France , the project offers tools that make it possible to simulate the results of each decision taken , and to work on role playing , making each group experience the reasons of the others .
" We use basically two kinds of software , multi @-@ agent modeling and role @-@ playing , which makes it possible for us to do an environmental analysis , integrating the knowledge of the various areas that are at work in the project " , says Yara Maria Chagas de Carvalho , the coordinator of the Brazilian group of Negowat .
Multi @-@ agent modeling is a new form of computer representation , developed in the last 15 years , and which uses object oriented language .
Frequently used in industry , air traffic control , urban traffic analysis , amongst others , this technique has been used in research centers for the management of natural resources .
The modeling is redone until the parties agree with the way they are being portrayed , and only then does the role @-@ playing begin .
The work is carried out with the members of the Upper Tietê Basin Committee , made up of representatives of the state , the city halls and of society at large , in the proportion of one third each .
The project should also be extended to the Guarapiranga and Upper Tietê Headwaters .
" The modeling is participative , and it could hardly be different in such a complex reality as the Brazilian one , where the pattern of occupation of the ground seems like a mosaic , with farming , houses and industry " , says French researcher Raphaele Ducrot , Negowat 's coordinator .
An identical project is being carried out in Bolivia .
Yara Carvalho believes that it will be possible , in one year , to have a precise diagnosis of the reality of the areas of the water sources in the two sub @-@ basins chosen , and a model with the conditions for doing simulations .
" From then on , we can see the effects of the various decisions that can be taken .

Impulse for scientific culture
Foundation assesses impact of its programs and creates news agency
FAPESP is launching a project for assessing the results of its policies for fostering research and a news agency to expand the range of its popularization of science .
Its starting point is producing and making known science among peers , a function that involves researchers and the institutional apparatus for fostering and producing knowledge ; it widens to the teaching of science and the education of scientists , involving scientists , professors and students , all the way from basic schooling to postgraduate studies ; it advances in the direction of teaching for science , where the actors range from professors and directors of museums to young scientists , and the circle is completed with the popularization of science , when the knowledge produced reverberates through society as a whole , before restarting the cycle , which gets wider and wider .
" The institution 's self @-@ knowledge , by means of the assessment of its programs , and the news agency , contribute towards the dynamics of this spiral " , Vogt explains .
The project for assessing the results of FAPESP 's foster policies is to cover aten @-@ year period .
It is divided into four subprojects .
In the first , already under way , an inventory is being drawn up of the park of medium and large sized equipment financed by the Foundation in its various special programs , its programs for technological innovation and the grants for research , taking into consideration its conditions of use and the environment to which it has been added .
This data will be gathered in the processes for rendering accounts -- which are being computerized -- and by means of electronic questionnaires that will be forwarded to the researchers and groups that received the benefits .
The information will be gathered together in a database , accessible to any researcher by the Internet .
The project will be concluded in the middle of the next half year .
" The idea is to form a diagnosis for a policy for granting new equipment " , Vogt explains .
The second subproject is going to outline the profile of the demand for finance from FAPESP , since 1992 , looking for data both on the researchers who had projects approved and on those who had their projects rejected .
" We know little about them " , Vogt explains .
With the same perspective , the third subproject will be tracking the scientific and professional trajectory of the researchers who , in the last few years , have enjoyed in some way assistance from FAPESP .
" This data is going to help the institution to get to know its role in the process of forming scientists " , Vogt says .
And , finally , the fourth subproject is going to assess the effects of the institution 's support for the companies that are part of the Small Business Innovation Research ( PIPE ) and the Partnership for Technological Innovation ( PITE ) programs , and to create indicators of performance .
The two programs have , respectively , 185 and 58 projects approved at various stages of development .
The details of the two programs will be collected at the Foundation 's Data Processing Center and by means of a questionnaire sent to the coordinators of the research groups , so as to establish criteria to make a comparison possible between the distinct enterprises .
The project is coordinated technically by the special advisor to the presidency , Jocimar Archângelo , who was responsible for the entrance exams at the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and for the implementation of the National Examination of Secondary Schooling ( Enem ) , of the Ministry of Education ( MEC ) .
The researcher responsible is Geraldo di Giovanni , from Unicamp 's College of Economics .
The subprojects will be coordinated by Helena Maria Cunha do Carmo Antunes , from the São Carlos School of Engineering , of the University of São Paulo ( EESC @-@ USP ) , and Eugênia Maria Reginato Charnet , from the Mathematics , Statistics and Scientific Computing Institute , at Unicamp .
At the end of June , FAPESP inaugurated a science and technology news agency , the FAPESP Agency , which has a website ( www.agencia.fapesp.br ) and daily bulletins distributed by e @-@ mail to a wide and diversified public , made up of researchers , directors of development agencies , universities and research institutes in Brazil , politicians , journalists , and others interested in science and technology .
The FAPESP Agency is integrated with the communication department , run by journalist Maria da Graça Mascarenhas .
Subscribing to the agency 's bulletins is free , and can be done on the website itself .
" The main role of the FAPESP Agency is to disseminate the culture of science " , says Vogt .
" It emerges as a natural need , since it is important to understand how science is done , but it is even more important to understand how science develops and evolves .
The news agency may be something new for FAPESP , from the point of view of an isolated novelty , but not from the point of view of the Foundation 's culture , which has always been oriented towards this kind of concern " .
The agency , however , has its own team , coordinated by journalist Heitor Shimizu .
The first bulletins were sent to some 15,000 readers , but straight away in the first week this mailing list grew considerably , chiefly by virtue of the requests made directly through the website .
Gratifying recognition
In June , Pesquisa FAPESP was recognized in double measure , in the Brazil 2003 Award for Reporting on Biodiversity in the Atlantic Rain Forest , sponsored by the Alliance for the Conservation of the Atlantic Rain Forest , an institution that comprises Conservation International and SOS Mata Atlântica ( Atlantic Rain Forest ) .
Our science editor , Carlos Fioravanti , won second place in the awards , and our special reporter , Marcos Pivetta , was given an honorable mention .
The two awards filled with happiness the whole team that produces this magazine , always with immense dedication , unquestionable rigor in ascertaining and setting out the facts in the stories , and a high level of professionalism .
The work that earned him this award was an article on the behavior of woolly spider monkeys , the cover story of our April issue -- the cover , by the way , conceived by our art director , Hélio de Almeida , was a very fine one , over an impressive image of one of those monkeys , captured by our photographer Miguel Boyayan .
As to 34 @-@ year @-@ old Pivetta , a native to the state of São Paulo , the owner of an exuberant , noisy temperament , always ready for outbursts of an acute sense of humor and refined irony , is endowed with talent in equal measure -- or too large to be measured -- for the various journalistic labors , and , in particular , for journalistic writing .
The work of his that merited an honorable mention was an article on new ways for conserving and multiplying pernambuco wood .
Prominence , too , for the article , of the authorship of Fioravanti , that reveals new data about the chemistry behind the exercise / well @-@ being couplet .
Physical activity as something important for the human organism is something that has been known for a long time .
The story that startson page 32 , though , goes beyond the obvious by showing the actual mechanisms that give sportsmen in more comfortable conditions for facing up to infections caused by viruses and bacteria.Finally ,
two other important news items .
In Policies , we show how the taxes paid by innovative companies are now higher than the investments applied in research ( page 16 ) .
And in Technology , we show a dressing of hydrogel that relieves the pain from burns and fights bacteria ( page 68 ) .
Good reading .

The power of transformation
Laboratory waste is reused in other experiments after recycling
Dinorah Ereno
The toxic foam left tons of dead fish in its trail , and put on alert entities linked to public health and the environment .
Accidents like this one would not happen if due care had been taken and the factory had adopted principles and methodologies like those in use for six years , with success , by the Center for Nuclear Energy in Agriculture ( Cena ) , of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , in Piracicaba .
The finding that it was necessary to establish standards for the disposal and recycling of the chemical products used for experiments was the starting point for developing , in 1997 , a program for managing chemical residue and wastewater in that plant .
The results can now be translated into environmental and economic gains .
Last year alone , some 400,000 liters of chemical waste , containing dangerous materials , were recycled .
Among the substances that are part of this volume are lead , silver , mercury , copper , zinc , selenium , bromine , ammonia , sulfides , methanol , acetone and chrome .
Several of them are reused in the lines of research pursued at the institute .
ccording to calculations by chemical engineer José Albertino Bendassolli , the coordinator of the Stable Isotopes Laboratory and of Cena 's program for managing chemical waste , the monthly savings with the reuse of these products is close to R $ 5,000 .
" That is R $ 60,000 a year , but if we take into consideration the program for managing water and electricity , we will be able to arrive at annual savings of R $ 200,000 .
These successful examples can be transferred to research and teaching institutions " , says Bendassolli .
Just in the system for producing demineralized water adopted by Cena , the annual savings with expenditure on water and electricity may add up to R $ 140,000 .
With the conventional process of distilling -- the one most used in teaching and research laboratories in Brazil -- , for each liter produced , from 15 to 20 liters of treated water are consumed in the refrigeration system , and most of it is discarded after the process .
By the calculations of the program 's coordinator , as Cena consumes about 60,000 liters of distilled water a month , the monthly wastage would be in the order of 900 cubic meters , which means 10.8 million liters a year .
And the electricity spent to produce 1 liter of distilled water is in the region of 0.7 kilowatts , which means 42,000 kilowatts per month .
Filters and sand
With the funds brought in from FAPESP in 2001 , by means of the Infrastructure Program V , the institute dimensioned and built a water production plant that uses basically gravity and pressure .
With this process , demineralized water is obtained by ionic exchange ( resins exchanging positive and negative charges ) .
The liquid from the public supply network of Piracicaba , from the Municipal Water and Sewage Service ( Semae ) , first of all passes from an activated charcoal filter and grains of sand of various sizes and , in succession , in big columns of transparent acrylic containing resins , responsible for retaining cations ( calcium , magnesium , potassium , sodium and some heavy metals ) and anions ( chlorides , sulfates , nitrates and carbonates , amongst others ) .
Next , the water passes through a system for disinfecting by ultraviolet light and by polypropylene filters with 5 @-@ micron slits .
" The result is that we have today 50 % of our units using this water " , Bendassolli says .
The laboratory is responsible for the whole Brazilian production of enriched compounds in the heavy isotopes of nitrogen and sulfur , therefore not radioactive , which are used mainly in agronomic research as tracers in assessing the cycle of nitrogen and sulfur in the soil @-@ plant system .
As in recent years there has been an increase in the consumption of these compounds , production needed to be expanded , which generated a larger volume of chemical effluents and the need for adopting a program for managing the waste .
Along with Esalq , Cena is part of USP 's campus in Piracicaba .
There are 37 teaching researchers , some 100 staffers and 150 postgraduate students working in 19 research laboratories .
Bendassolli recalls the beginning of the program , when the first task already gave an idea of what was awaiting the team involved .
In an open deposit , without any kind of organization , they found 5 tons of waste , precariously packed and , to a great extent , without any kind of labeling .
The first step was to classify what they could identify .
" In all , about 2.1 tons of the material was incinerated , because they were not set aside at the source where they were generated " , he says .
The incineration was done by Basf , in Guaratinguetá , and was accompanied by the Environmental Sanitation Technology Company ( Cetesb ) .
Database
The original deposit was then remodeled , within strict criteria for storing material , and the waste divided into 11 classes .
Bendassolli notes that as this environment is a provisional storage place , the discarded material must remain there for 120 days at the most .
Afterwards , it has to be recovered or incinerated .
A computerized database developed by Cena 's Information Technology Laboratory supplies detailed quantitative and qualitative data on the stored waste generated in the institution 's lines of research and teaching , besides technical information on over 200 dangerous chemical compounds .
The team also produced a videotape with the results of the waste management program , shown to groups that visit the institution .
One important result displayed to the visitors is the recycling of a great deal of aqueous waste containing such dangerous products as cyanide , ammonia , sulfide , bromine and others .
They are recycled and used again in other lines of research at Cena , while solids like fluorescent lamps are sent to a company that carries out the recycling of mercury .
Silver waste , for example , is recovered and used as silver oxide in other analytic processes .
" This material is an expensive reagent that we use , for example , in determining the sulfur in plants " , says Bendassolli .
Then there is chrome , which is used as potassium dichromate in several analytic processes .
Without oxygen
Metallic copper , used to extract the excess of oxygen from samples of soil , sediments and plants before passing through a mass spectrometer , is recycled in its original form .
By retaining the excess oxygen from the samples , the copper becomes oxidized and loses its function , besides being toxic .
To bring it back to metallic copper , it undergoes a process known as oxidation @-@ reduction , which consists of using hydrogen at 450 ° C to remove the oxygen .
The recycling of the copper that comes from three pieces of Cena 's equipment means annual savings of this imported raw material in the order of USD 12,000 .
Although many of these processes are conventional , they are not always used by the universities or even by industrial concerns .
" Companies produce a large quantity of waste , but with less variety .
Universities , though , produce a lower quantity , but there is much more diversity .
Our objective is to make it possible for the processes developed here to be transferred " , says the program 's coordinator .
In his assessment , one way of passing this knowledge on is by means of the undergraduate course in Environmental Management at Esalq , which has the purpose of forming environmental managers .
Bendassolli is responsible for one subject matter -- which features on the scheduled curriculum for 2005 , when the pupils of the first intake of this new course are in their final year -- which addresses the question of safety and the treatment of chemical waste in laboratories .
Another way of passing it on is to receive secondary school and university students at Cena 's laboratories .
Program in the shopping mall
One of these visits has already borne fruit .
Two students who work in a factory in Piracicaba realized that some of the procedures adopted by the company could be modified , and they put into practice techniques they had learnt at Cena .
Bendassolli also regards it as important to show the university 's work to the community .
So , at the beginning of June , Glauco Tavares , Gleison de Souza and Felipe Rufino Nolasco , who are members of the team , presented the waste program at a shopping mall in Piracicaba , as part of the activities connected with the Environment Week .
One month from now , Cena will be finishing its participation in Infrastructure V.
According to Bendassolli , for Cena 's program to continue , some R $ 60,000 a year will be needed for inputs , maintenance of the equipment and development of new methods , besides hiring technical personnel ( staff exclusive to the program ) .
" As research is dynamic , with various experiments , we always have to think of new methodologies of treatment for the other compounds that arise " , says the program 's coordinator .
This amount represents a small fraction , compared to what has been invested up to now , about R $ 1 million , amongst funds from FAPESP , the Program for Supporting Centers of Excellence ( Pronex ) , run by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development ( CNPq ) , USP and from Cena itself .
After so much effort and the results shown , it would make no sense , as Bendassolli says , to abandon what has been done .

Relief for burns
Hydrogel dressing lessens pain , prevents skin from drying up and fights bacteria
Yuri Vasconcelos
The treatment for burns should shortly have a new ally .
The novelty arose at the Chemistry Institute of the University of São Paulo ( IQ @-@ USP ) , where researchers have developed a dressing of hydrogel strengthened with polypropylene fibers , a plastic material , ideal for treating burns .
Hydrogels are polymeric materials , with a consistency similar to gelatin , which retain water in their structure .
The bandages made with this biomaterial , which are also called membranes , are no novelty in the market , but their mechanical fragility prevents them from being used in a generalized way in hospitals , because they burst easily when handled .
The doctors also complain that the dressing is too small and does not cover large areas of the body .
With the polypropylene reinforcement developed at USP , the dressings can be made to any size , and not just the standard size of 8 by 15 centimeters .
The perfecting of the product was the work of chemist Luiz Henrique Catalani and his team .
The biggest advantage over the traditional dressings , made of gauze , is that they reduce the pain caused by the burn .
" This sensation occurs because of the exposure of nerve endings in the wounds .
By keeping the burnt area moist , the pain diminishes by over 90 % and brings great relief to the patients " , explains Catalani .
Another advantage of hydrogel is that it speeds up the process scar formation , since it keeps the burn hydrated all the time .
Furthermore , as it is impermeable to microorganisms -- the web of the membrane is in the order of from 5 to 7 nanometers ( millionth parts of a millimeter ) -- , it prevents infection by bacteria .
At the same time , the wound is kept aired , because the dressing is permeable to oxygen .
Gel sandwich
To develop a bigger , strengthened membrane , Catalani tested several materials until coming across polypropylene fiber .
" But it had a problem : it was hydrophobic , incompatible with the aqueous medium .
The solution was to make a copolymer ( a molecular joining of two polymers ) with a hydrophilic material , which absorbs water .
The resulting product then became compatible with hydrogel .
From then on , we did an assembly with two outer layers of PVP and an inner one of polypropylene " , Catalani explains .
Tests indicated that the new dressing is eight times more resistant than the original one .
The result achieved at the IQ @-@ USP was transformed into a patent filed at the National Institute of Industrial Property ( INPI ) , with funding from FAPESP 's Nucleus for Patenting and Licensing Technology ( Nuplitec ) .
Catalani is now negotiating with the Biolab @-@ Sanus pharmaceutical company for the reinforced membrane to be produced commercially .
The laboratory is a partner of Ipen in the development of the unreinforced hydrogel membrane .
Twenty thousand prototypes of this membrane have been undergoing tests since March this year at 20 hospitals in Brazil .
" Depending on the results , Biolab @-@ Sanus will kick off commercial production , but no date has been defined " , explains chemical engineer Ademar Lugão , the researcher at Ipen responsible for bringing the technology for hydrogel dressings to Brazil .
Developing the dressing was not the only contribution from Professor Catalani and his team for the treatment of burns .
They also created a cheaper and more accessible way for producing the membranes .
By the conventional system , used by Ipen , the polymeric solution in a liquid state needs to be exposed to high @-@ energy radiation -- a beam of electrons or gamma radiation -- to acquire the consistency of gel .
This method is highly effective , because it brings about simultaneously reticulation ( a formation of crossed reactions between the polymeric chains that transform the aqueous solution into gel ) and sterilization of the dressing , but it has a problem : there are few companies and institutions that have the necessary equipment for doing it .
" In the light of this limitation , we decided to create another system for producing it , without high energy radiation " , Catalani explains .
" We discovered , then , that it was possible to produce the hydrogel dressings with ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation using PVP , something unprecedented in the production of hydrogel for biomedical use . "
Simple and cheap
When it was first discovered , the process would take a few hours , which made it impracticable commercially .
The technique was perfected and the processing time reduced , on a laboratory scale , to less than 30 minutes .
" That is still far longer than the time with high energy radiation , which is instantaneous , but it does have countless advantages .
It is cheap , simple and accessible . "
With it , businesspersons interested in manufacturing the membranes will be able to carry out the whole process on their own premises , which is not possible in the other system , because high @-@ energy irradiation is necessarily outsourced .
The big difference between the dressings formed by this process and the traditional ones is that they do not have a predefined format .
The membrane molds itself to the area to which is applied and is ideal for regions of the body like the hands and toes .
It works by placing the PVP onto the body , without having irradiated it , in the affected area .
Next , a substance is sprinkled over the product , bringing about oxidation @-@ reduction and transforming it into gel .
" As far as I know , this hydrogel is without precedent in the world . "
It is being finalized and awaits the results of the tests for toxicity done by the Adolfo Lutz Institute .

Inside the tubes
New methodology for analyzing petrochemical equipment
A serious problem for petrochemical companies is the wear and tear undergone by the steel tubes used in the production of ethylene , a raw material used in making polymers like polyethylene and polypropylene , used , for example , in making packaging and parts for the automobile industry .
Produced from a family of refractory ( heat resistant ) steels , these tubes suffer from wear from the action of the high temperatures and of the gases used in synthesizing polymers .
Accordingly , the quality of these tubes is a fundamental factor for avoiding the constant changing of the tubing and bringing production to a halt .
t was to get a precise understanding of this wear and tear that a team from the Technological Research Institute of the State of São Paulo ( IPT ) decided to develop a new methodology for testing , capable of assessing the behavior of the heat resistant metallic alloys under the conditions met in the production of the polymers .
The environment where these tubes in a serpentine shape work is in the inside of furnaces for pyrolysis ( decomposition by heat , without the presence of oxygen ) .
In the production of ethylene , the outer surface of the tubes reaches temperatures of up to 1,150 degrees centigrade .
The result is the appearance of two phenomena , called fluency and carburetion .
In the former , deformations occur as a result of the tensions caused by heating .
In the latter , there is a marked degradation caused by the diffusion of carbon atoms in the inside of the tubing .
Generally speaking , the tubes are designed for a useful life of 100,000 hours ( about 11 years ) , but , due to carburetion , this period is reduced by as much as 50 % .
The partner company is Engemasa , a refractory steel tube maker from São Carlos ( SP ) .
It was not , however , the first industrial concern to be involved in the project .
When it was conceived , in 1997 , the partnership took place with Aços Villares , which used to have a factory making these tubes .
While the project was being assessed by the Foundation , the company closed down this unit 's activities .
The researchers from the IPT then offered the project to Fundinox , a division of Sulzer Brazil .
The company accepted , and research was started in May 2000 .
A little while later , Fundinox was bought by a major German manufacturer , which did not show any interest for the work .
Change in partnership
" As the project was already under way , FAPESP agreed to it going on without a partnership with a company , until we knocked on the door of Engemasa " , says Mário Boccalini , a researcher from the IPT 's Metallurgy Division .
The work was concluded in April this year , and the results show in detail the general laws covering the two phenomena that affect the tubes .
" We made technological progress that is without precedent in Brazil .
We managed to reproduce accurately the physical and chemical conditions that occur in the furnaces , and , from then on , we were able to get a better understanding of fluency and carburetion , explains physicist Zehbour Panossian , the coordinator of the PITE project and head of the IPT 's Corrosion and Protection Group .
To understand the significance of this project 's tests and its results , the two phenomena that affect the tubes need to be known .
According to Boccalini , fluency is a deformation caused by two kinds of strains : the pressure caused by the gas that circulates within the tube , and the longitudinal tension brought about by the weight of the tubes .
They are usually around 10 meters long and from 5 to 20 centimeters in diameter .
When submitted to high temperatures , they may experience deformations of up to 10 centimeters in their length .
" This is harmful because it affects the soundness of the tubes , making them fragile and subject to cracks .
The tubes therefore lose their capacity for deformation and become more susceptible to the occurrence of catastrophic fracture ( breakage of the tube ) " , Boccalini explains .
When this happens , the material has to be repaired or exchanged , bringing the company serious losses .
To carry out the tests that would make it possible to assess the behavior of the alloys -- made up of iron , chrome , nickel and a small 0.8 % addition of carbon -- when submitted to carburetion , the researchers made a synthetic atmosphere with methane and hydrogen in the inside of a furnace containing cylindrical test bodies of 10 millimeters in diameter by 70 millimeters in length .
The temperature inside was kept at as much as 1,150 degrees centigrade , and each test ( there were 25 in all ) lasted about 100 hours .
After the small cylinders left the furnace , they were measured to identify the variation in mass .
Next , they would undergo a microstructural analysis using several instruments .
In these analyses , layers of metal were removed to find out up to what point and in what quantity the carbon atoms had penetrated the alloy .
" In some cases , 5 % of the mass of the tube was made up of carbon , which went so far as to spread itself for 5 millimeters into the test body " , says a metallurgical engineer with the IPT , Marcelo Moreira , who was responsible for the tests .
As a result , it was noticed that the carbon level went up from 0.8 % to 5 % .
This enabled Engemasa to start making products with a better capacity for use in the petrochemical plants .

Flights of innovation
Company develops systems for aerial mapping and cargo tracking
For a company , technological innovation is the way most elaborate for going far , both in the financial sphere and in the geographical one .
This thesis is confirmed by the experience of Orbisat , from São José dos Campos ( SP ) .
The company developed an airborne radar system for producing maps in three dimensions ( 3D ) and won a contract for the provision of services in surveying the topographical characteristics of roughly 25 % of the territory of Venezuela , worth â  ¬ 3.5 million .
This kind of technology is mastered by only two other companies in the whole world : Intermap , from the United States , and Aerosensing , from Germany .
Competing with the American supplier , with an advantage in price and technology , Orbisat won the contract from our neighboring country .
It is the first GPS device developed in Brazil .
For the end of this year , the company is preparing a communication and security system for haulage companies , also via satellite , that will be used to monitor and control cargo .
" Our revenues , R $ 19 million in 2002 , should rise to R $ 30 million in 2003 " , forecasts Rogério Ferraz de Camargo , the company 's general director .
A forecast of this order would not even have passed through Camargo 's head back in 1984 , when , as an engineer recently graduated from the Technological Institute of Aeronautics ( ITA ) , he decided to set up the company , that , with the name of Databus Engenharia , was to dedicate itself to engineering projects in the areas of electronics and telecommunications .
The company then had sales amounting to some dozens of thousands of reais a year , and few employees .
At the end of the 80s , Camargo took leave from the business to do a doctoral course in robotics in the Laboratory for Analysis and Architure of Systems Analysis Laboratory ( LAAS ) , in Toulouse , in France .
" I went back to Brazil in 1991 , with the idea of devoting myself to academic research " , he recalls .
Having already lectured at the ITA , he went back onto the institute 's staff , where to this date he is a professor , working part time .
Camargo reactivated the company in 1994 , and , two years later , glimpsed an opportunity in the television market in Brazil .
Now with the name of Databus Sankay , the company started to produce equipment for receiving TV signals via satellite .
" Then , in 1999 , we opened up a branch in Manaus , to take advantage of the tax benefits of the Manuas Free Trade Zone " , Camargo says .
At the end of 2000 , now with the name of Orbisat , the enterprise had 40 employees and sales of R $ 5 million .
But to carry on growing , he knew that they needed technology .
At the beginning of 2001 , João Roberto Moreira Neto , who had also graduated in engineering from the ITA and concluded his doctorate at the German Aerospace Center ( DLR ) in 19871987 , to settle in Germany , confessed a dilemma to Camargo , who was a friend of his since their schooldays : he wanted to go back to Brazil , but did not see many possibilities for applying , here , the knowledge he had built up there .
Camargo proposed him a partnership in Orbisat .
Moreira accepted and took on the responsibility for creating the radar for mapmaking and the company 's remote sensing division , which currently has 30 employees out of a total of one hundred ; eight of them are doctors and seven have a master 's degree .
Moreira , nowadays Orbisat 's managing director , brought with him the suppositions that were to guide the radar project , baptized as OrbiSAR @-@ 1 : the system for the mapmaking segment and the InSAR ( interferometric synthetic aperture radar ) technology .
These radars , which transmit waves and record them immediately after they hit the Earth , operate under any atmospheric condition or light .
They replace the aerial photographs traditionally used to produce maps , with enormous benefits in cost , time and precision .
" They make it possible to carry out , in a little more than six months , a job that would take ten years with photogrammetry " , he compares.Moreira 's
objective since the beginning of the project was for the radar to capture images in two simultaneous frequencies , to supply both the height of the trees or the buildings and the ground covered by vegetation , buildings etc .
Other advantages , according to Rogério , are speed in the delivery of the end products to the customers and better resolution : 25 centimeters by 25 , against the 50 by 50 of the other companies .
The secret for arriving at these figures lies in the project for the system 's analog and digital circuits and in the software for processing the images .
After all the targets set by Moreira had been met , Orbisat applied for finance from the National Bank for Economic and Social Development ( BNDES ) , in July 2001 , with the support of the Society for the Promotion of Excellence in Brazilian Software ( Softex ) .
And the R $ 4.5 million loan needed to be used quickly , due to an unexpected success .
In November , the company , in a consortium with the German company Infoterra , won the international tender process for the Venezuelan government 's Cartosur II project , financed by the World Bank .
The intention was to capture and to process digital radar images covering about 253,000 square kilometers of territory between the states of Bolívar and Delta Amacuro , in the central and northwestern regions of Venezuela .
With its superior technology and a price 30 % lower than its competitor 's , Orbisat won the â  ¬ 6 million contract , in which its own share is â  ¬ 3.5 million .
But the problem is that the system was not ready .
The InSAR software developed by Orbisat provides for the inclusion , in the maps , of contour lines and several other elements of ground cover , such as the kinds of forests , courses and bodies of water , roads , etc .
The company is now working on the development of the LightSAR radar .
" As many applications do not call for a 25 centimeter resolution , we intend to launch a simplified version of the OrbiSAR @-@ 1 , to bring down even further the cost of the services and , by doing so , to expand the potential market " , he reveals .
Brazilian Amazonia , for example , has still not been mapped this way , and in future the system can even be used by municipal governments to control then expansion of built @-@ up areas and for the purposes of tax collecting " , Camargo notes .
Logistics and security
The recent launch of the GPS receiver module is also expanding Orbisat 's business horizon .
The device , which can be marketed on its own , will be part of a communication and security system for freight carriers .
It will be launched in the second half of this year and will be operating with GlobalStar , an American company that has a constellation of communication satellites and telephone and data services for the whole of the planet .
" This product will give us an advantage in price of about 50 % , compared with the similar ones that are one the market " , Camargo says cheerfully .
Another differential of the cargo monitoring system will be the transmission of voice and data and access to the Internet by means of a modem that is capable of operating as well in cell phone frequencies .
" The equipment will have a small keyboard attached and the smallest antenna in the market , which makes it more interesting for applications where security is the main objective " , Camargo explains .
The development of the user terminal that will be installed , for example , in the cab of the truck , enjoyed support from FAPESP under the Small Business Innovation Research Program ( PIPE ) , in a project that started in 1999 .
All the system 's electronic circuits were developed by Orbisat , under the general coordination of researcher Joel Muniz Bezerra .
" Brazil 's fleet of trucks has over 10 million vehicles " , Bezerra says .
" Some time from now , the use of remote monitoring systems will be a requirement of the insurance companies . "

Genomic difference
Analyzing alterations in nucleotides is a theme for Scylla 's first commercial software
Marcos de Oliveira
After getting a big boost in its development with the genome projects that have spread over the world and over Brazil , bioinformatics is beginning to stand out as an important area for the generation of technological innovation .
One of these fruits originating from genomic research is software produced by Scylla , a company from Campinas , for the Psychiatry Institute of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) .
It is a system for identifying genetic differences , called polymorphisms , in the sequences of the chemical bases that form genes , the famous adenine , cytosine , thymine and guanine , also known as nucleotides .
A differentiated sequence , or just one letter -- which indicates one of these substances in a given gene -- may lead to a predisposition towards mental illnesses , for example .
The great majority of people always have one sequence , like , for example , ATTGCATG .
If we find in the same gene , but in another person , the sequence ATTGCTTG , with an A being replaced by a T , then , one first sees whether there has been some error in the process of getting the data ; if the difference persists , a comparison is made with the person 's medical condition " , explains Professor João Meidanis , from the Theory of Computing Department of the State University of Campinas ( Unicamp ) and Scylla 's founder .
Two former pupils of Meidanis , Alexandre Corrêa Barbosa and Zanoni Dias , are in the company as partners .
They started Scylla in 2002 , after a long period taking part in the bioinformatics area of the genome projects on theXyllela fastidiosa andXanthomonas citri bacteria and on sugarcane , of which Meidanis was one of the coordinators .
World @-@ wide database
In the Human Genome alone , there are over 4 million SNPs .
They are identified as such if they are present in 1 % of the population .
What is known about them is recorded in world @-@ wide databases of polymorphisms , which , with the help of the software , will be accessed to identify and classify the SNPs by the team coordinated by Professor Emmanuel Dias Neto , from the Neurosciences Laboratory of the Psychiatry Institute at USP 's Hospital and Clinics . " This
information will be useful , for example , for us to analyze a group of 500 persons , of which 250 with schizophrenia and 250 from a control group without this illness .
We can then see the differences in the bases and relate them to an ailment " , Dias Neto explains .
" We are also looking for polymorphisms that may mean resistance to medicines .
The SNPs may be responsible for the ineffectiveness of certain drugs in some people . "
Synthesizing an altered protein , caused by a given SNP , may influence the chemical connections that make the medicine be an efficient one .
" There are individuals who respond to lithium ( a substance used against depression ) , and others who don 't .
We want to understand and to characterize the genes connected with these clinical responses " , says Dias Neto .
The software developed by Scylla may thus be useful for other research centers and laboratories and for the pharmaceutical industry .
Clients in a network
In a practical way , the software has a server that makes it possible for several clients to participate .
They can then run the program on a local network or not , on a Linux or Windows platform .

More comfort and efficiency
Biodegradable microspheres and ocular implants do away with injections inseveral treatments
Liliane Nogueira
Technological advances in the production of medicines has to search for solutions that are less aggressive and more effective in the absorption of drugs by the organism .
In the developed countries , the pharmaceutical industry invests fortunes in the quest for therapeutic quality and more comfort to the patients .
In Brazil , in spite of the small size of investments in this sector , examples of competence and of the mastery of technology are popping up , with results similar to those of the major multinational laboratories .
This is the case of a patent filed last April with the National Institute of Intellectual Property ( INPI ) by the Federal University of Minas Gerais ( UFMG ) , which registers the technique for encapsulating insulin in biodegradable microspheres ( polymer compounds ) .
The use of biodegradable polymers in the preparation of new medicines is also made by him in the ophthalmologic area .
" We have developed implants , in the form of a stick to be installed in the hind part of the eye , which releases drugs for a few months , while the polymeric material is degraded in the organism " , Cunha Júnior explains .
For the time being , researches with the ophthalmic implant are concentrated on medicines intended for treating uveitis .
This disease was originally an inflammation of the uveal tract , made up of the iris , the ciliary body and the choroid ( a membrane located in front of the retina ) , but the term has also been employed for inflammations in adjacent structures , such as the retina and the optic nerve .
Uveites can be caused by surgical or accidental traumas , by external microorganisms , or may arise secondarily , associated with diseases like tuberculosis , toxoplasmosis and others .
The first step is to treat it with the conventional corticoid based eye drops .
However , the majority of times , this practice does not generate any results , and it becomes necessary to make use of medicine orally or by intraocular injections .
Besides being painful , this treatment hardly ever brings good results and is , in large measure , the cause of blindness .
Interests in innovation
Cunha Júnior is enthusiastic with the repercussion that this kind of ophthalmologic implant may have in the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry .
" We have already made some contacts with Brazilian laboratories interested in developing the product " , he reveals .
But the same is not happening with the insulin microspheres .
" Theproblem is that there is no company in Brazil that is interested in transforming this innovation into a product " , says the professor .
The research that he carried out was done with insulin given by Biobras -- the only factory of this medicine in Brazil , located in Montes Claros , in the north of Minas Gerais -- , which produces this hormone .
The tests were done on diabetic rats and mice , which responded well to the treatment with the encapsulated insulin .
The next step would be to carry out clinical tests on humans , but there was not enough time .
In February 2002 , Biobras was sold to the pharmaceutical laboratory Novo Nordisk , from Denmark , and UFMG 's research was interrupted .
" We believe that , with the sale of this Brazilian company , the prospects for marketing have disappeared .
There is not at the moment , in Brazil , any interest in the encapsulated insulin , not least because we do not have any more a genuinely national company to produce the hormone and wants to develop here a new therapeutic method .
Knowing the market as I do , I don 't have any hopes " , the researcher complains .
And he is talking as someone who knows .
In the period between his graduation from the School of Pharmacy at UFMG , in 1986 , and his postgraduate studies ( for a master 's degree and a doctorate ) , in France , at Paris XI University , from 1993 to 1997 , Cunha Júnior worked with insulin in its traditional form , at Biobras .
It was at that time that he began to be interested in new pharmaceutical forms , the theme of his dissertation for a master 's degree and of his thesis for his doctor 's degree .
In 1997 , he received from the Association de Pharmacie Galénique Industrielle , or the Association of Galenic Industrial Pharmacy -- Galenic meaning pharmacotechnics or pharmaceutical manipulation -- and from the Association de Recherches Scientifiques Paul Neumann , or the Paul Neumann for Scientific Research Association -- he was the founder of the old Hoechst laboratory , now bound up with Aventis , the prize for the best thesis on pharmaceutical technology prepared in France in that year .
The fact is that insulin in an aerosol will certainly arrive here , albeit imported .
At the same time that the research was being carried on at UFMG 's School of Pharmacy , two small American high technology laboratories , the Inhale Therapeutics of San Carlos and the Aradigm Corporation , both from California , associated with the giants Pfizer and Aventis , were investing in similar research , which , with a few differences in the technological process , also resulted in the products as a base for an aerosol .
The difference is that there the new format insulin is about to go onto the market .
Smaller doses
Even disillusioned with the current impossibility for insulin in an aerosol with Brazilian technology to reach the market , Cunha does not balk at pointing out the advantages of this new pharmaceutical form .
He guarantees that the microencapsulation of insulin brings about the necessary protection for the stability of the hormone and facilitates its absorption by the organism .
Moreover , it is more comfortable to apply and more effective in the treatment .
" The pulmonary alveoli are extremely thin and permeable , making themselves a far easier barrier to overcome than the subcutaneous tissue .
The doses can be smaller than those used subcutaneously , and the effect is more satisfactory " , the researcher explains .
The polymers used in the researches , known as PLGA , are derived from glycolic and lactic acids -- the same raw material used to make biodegradable threads for stitches .
In the work that led to the implant , another additional kind of technology was necessary .
" In conjunction with UFMG 's Mechanical Engineering Department , we designed and built a prototype piece of equipment for compressing the powder containing a drug and a polymer , which is then molded into the format of a stick , 4 millimeters in length by 1 millimeter in diameter , which acts as a basis for an intraocular implant " , the researcher explains .
The implant done in a minor surgical operation , when the biodegradable stick is put in the hind part of the eye .
" Now , my hopes are concentrated on the ophthalmologic line . "
For the time being , the implants are being tested in rabbits , which show a similar eye structure to the human one , including their size .
These studies are carried out in conjunction with the School of Medical Sciences of the University of São Paulo ( USP ) , in Ribeirão Preto .
The next step is to draw up a patent for this new therapeutic method as well .

Broken Barriers
In practice , the Brazilian space program began 40 years ago
Neldson Marcolin
The moment was one of pure excitement .
Since October 1957 , when the Soviets sent the first artificial satellite into space , four months ahead of the Americans , the world accompanied the then recent space race with enchantment .
The possibility of reaching and getting to know new worlds outside the Earth gripped everyone and started off a new era of unprecedented scientific and technological development .
Not to be left aside from these advances , in 1961 the Brazilian government created a commission to study and to suggest a policy for space research .
A dozen people , all from the field of Aeronautics , began to work at the Aerospace Technical Center ( CTA ) .
In 1963 , engineers from the Technological Institute of Aeronautics ( ITA ) joined these pioneers and went on to find a place in the northeast of Brazil close to the equator that could serve as a base for launching small and medium sized orbital rockets .
The choice fell on a 5,000 square meter site 18 kilometers from Natal , in Rio Grande do Norte , called Barreira do Inferno [ Hell 's Barrier ] by the fishermen -- there is a red cliff at the place that shines intensely at sunrise , and , from the sea , gives the impression that it is in flames .
It was there , in practice , that Brazilian space research began .
On December 15 , 1965 , with the Barreira do Inferno launch center partly set up , Nasa 's Nike @-@ Apache rocket was successfully fired and tracked -- the objective was to carry out measurements in the lower layers of the ionosphere .
Since then , Barreira do Inferno has seen a large number of launches and has been able to build and test Brazilian rockets .
Later on , when more daring projects were being thought about , the center became too small .
" But Barreira do Inferno has never stopped launching rockets " , explains Adauto Motta , head of the Regional Center of the National Institute for Space Research ( Inpe ) in the northeast .
Motta wrote the bookEsboço Histórico da Pesquisa Espacial ( Historical Outline of Space Research in Brazil- Editora Foco ) and was head of operations at Barreira do Inferno for six years .
Nowadays , the place is used to test rockets with a military purpose and for research , with a payload from Inpe .
